<H1>Survex To-Do List</H1>

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<ul>

<li>This gives "*** Singular!!!" warning with DEBUG_INVALID on:
<pre>
1 2 50000 0 -
1 2 5 0 -30
</pre>

<li>aven: loading a .3d file with no survey data (or which has a valid header but is broken later) with a survey already loaded doesn't work well.

<li>img.c: eliminate duplicate img_LABELs when reading .PLT files.

<li>multiple readings:
<p>
average bearings specially - they don't average like normal numbers
<p>
%age gradients should probably average the same as angle gradients
<p>
Document - works like so:
<pre>
*set open {
*set close }
*calibrate compass {000.5 001.0 001.25}
1 2 10.23 {000 001} -02
2 3 {10.16 10.17} 127 {+06 +05}
3 4 11.98 007 {+03 +03}
</pre>
Implement as extension to number format so any suitable numeric value to be
repeated?
</ul>

<H2>Aven</H2>

<ul>

<li>check on monochrome, 16, and 256 colour displays - especially that depth
colouring looks OK

<li>Feed back redraw time to key based movement as in caverot?  Or perhaps best
not to?  It depends on whether we expect people to hold down keys or not...
Perhaps something smart where the first press is a fixed size, then after that
it depends on the redraw?
</ul>

<H2>Printing</H2>

<ul>

<li>Check skip blank pages works (checked printps)...

<li>printdm: put standard scaling in print.ini for canon bj
(work out what's up with vertical size...)

</ul>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<ul>

<li>Platform specific versions of docs?

<li>Put more terms in terminology in docs ? trip, instrument, ...

<li>Finish off manual loose ends.

<li>Look at using docbook2man instead of docbook-to-man (command is
<i>nsgmls man_aven.sgml | sgmlspl /usr/lib/perl5/sgmlspl-specs/docbook2man-spec.pl</i>).  Issues are: double space between sentences is lost;
double blank lines appear in output; &amp;bsol; isn't understood.

<li>Make sure there's documentation for all the various settings in print.ini
(colours aren't documented at present)

</ul>

<H2>Survex file format</H2>

<ul>

<li>flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce points for a surface triangulation...

<li>?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

<li>comma separated dates in *date?

<li>Find a solution to Thilo's "." problem.

<li>Units in *fix (currently metres)

</ul>

<H2>Internationalisation and Localisation</H2>

<ul>

<li>quotes in messages - translate too? e.g. `XXX' to « XXX ».  Eric
suggests not in French.

<li>extract --help messages for translation.

<li>control of output units in .err file and in stats at end of cavern run?
In fact anywhere we report a value in degrees or metres, the units should be
selectable

</ul>

<H2>Test Suite</H2>

<ul>

<li>test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

<li>more tests for direction

<li>improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

<li>Compass .mak and .plt and CMAP .xyz in test suite?

<li>img.c: test routines in test suite?

</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<ul>

<li>resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

<li>Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

<li>Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?  Beware of issues like those that revcomplist test checks.

<li>Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

<li>flag nosurvey legs in .3d file

<li>sort out title which goes in .3d file for this (if no *includes in ...
it gets the title of the leafname of this .svx file, otherwise it's the
leafnames of the *include-d files, comma-separated):

<pre>
*begin mycave
*title "My Cave"
...
*end mycave
</pre>

<li>make img more modular (convert to C++?)

<li>add support for .KST?  Gary says documentation is out of date, and recent
releases of winkarst have broken .KST export/import...

<li>resolve documentation/examples mismatch for station based .XYZ files and
implement reading of legs from them.

<li>diffpos: compare connectivity (i.e legs as well as stations) - e.g.

<pre>
foo.1 moved by (0.02, 0.10, -0.06)
leg between foo.1 and bar.2 removed
...
bar.2 moved by (-0.02, -0.05, 0.03)
</pre>

<li>improve .plt export to include less crude survey structure.

<li>MacOS X packaging - make Aven.app a bundle - structure like so:
<pre>
	Aven.app/
		Contents/
			MacOS/
				Aven
		Info.plist
		Resources/
</pre>

And we need to set Aven.app's bundle bit.

<li>look at solution by QR factorisation in matrix.c more

<li>consider disabling the more expensive asserts - turning them all off
speeds up cavern by about 10%.
</ul>
