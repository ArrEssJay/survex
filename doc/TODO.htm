<H1>Survex To-Do List</H1>

<ul>

<li>Update translations.

<li>After keyboard controlled movement, the measuring line/circle doesn't
reappear until the mouse is moved (e.g. plan/elevation transition with P/L).

<li>Save cavern log from aven?

<li>Sort out display of full unicode in OpenGL window (currently we only
handle latin1 there, which is sufficient for all the current i18ns).

<li>img should return img_XSECT from Compass PLT files.

<li>Fix depth clipping on grid

<li>Consider using "legend" instead of "info box"...

<li>Reword "Shift Survey Left", etc?

<li>Look at rewording extend.sgml (AndyA comments)

<li>message.c should perhaps use GetUserDefaultUILanguage() on WinMe/Windows2000 or
later to find language id.  It's what MS say you should use, although some of
the comments here suggest that perhaps it's not ideal (and wx still uses
GetUserDefaultLCID() too):

<li>Lots of aven things need documenting.

<li>Does anyone use Controls-&gt;"Reverse Sense"?  It made some sense with
caverot but now seeing the mouse pointer makes people expect the default
motions (for right button drag particularly).

<li>Clean up export.cc and allow scale, line width, etc to be specified

<li>Better handling of missing LRUD values

<li>Smooth wrinkles in presentation code (stop pres on Open or
New, changing focus on listctrl as presentation plays doesn't really work
properly)

<li>Draw the measuring line directly onto the front buffer, so we can remove it
with a copy from the back buffer and redraw it in the new position without a
re-render.

<li>Round the measuring line coords so the ring is a nice shape?  Or just
antialias the ring, "there" blob and line?

<li>Process all pending input before rerendering to improve responsiveness.

<li>Check timing code - we need to glFinish to ensure it's all drawn, and that
may be needed to get meaningful timing info.

<li>3d format:
<ul>
  <li>sort out XSECT - I'm sure I meant there to be 1 and 2 byte forms, not 2
  and 4 - 4 byte is only useful if a passage dimension is &gt; 327.67m!

  <li>add "this is an extended elevation" flag

  <li>store "file processed on" date as a time_t rather than a string?

  <li>store equated stations in some way

  <li>store legs by end stations rather than repeating coordinates over and
  over?
</ul>

<li>Add "colour by survey" - colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
maybe "aven --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

<li>Implement "Skip blank pages" in aven printing

<li>Terrain data (patch from PhilU)

<li>*fix with datums etc

<li>different keyboard layouts mean that some key choices don't make much sense...

<li>*data chamber ...

<li>*data nsew ... for pitches (bearings rather than having to be NSEW)

<li>Easy way to "print extended elevation"

<li>Optional lazy label redraw during drags?  Or turn on at some redraw time
threshold...

<li>
Warn bearings not 3 digits, gradient not &lt;sign&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;

<li>Allow angles as deg/min/sec (for theodolite data) (060&deg;10'15" as 060 10
15, or 060.1005 (crap notation))

<li>Add support for bearings of form N20E (ie [NS][0-9]+[EW])?

<li>should % after a clino reading work?

<li>cavern: auto declination?

<li>Sort out gross error detection code

<li>Fixing a point by triangulation?

<li>Theodolite + level:
<ul>
  <li>delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  <li>delta(horizontal)
  <li>delta(vertical) / maybe "clino" instead
</ul>

<li>Theodolite only:
<ul>
  <li>delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  <li>delta(horizontal)
  <li>infinite sd for z
</ul>

<li>Infinite sds so we can fix in x and y only (or z only)?

<li>use more accuracy than nearest point (1/72") in printps?

<li>Some way to view older/newer version of survey

<li>Label lengths aren't considered when working out image size when
printing so a long label can spill off the edge of the printout

<li>For warnings such as "Suspicious compass reading", report the reading
in question in the error message (in the text form given in the file).
Also report values when warning about problems with processed readings.

<li>legs: implied: inloop/plumb/nosurvey, diving, other styles

<li>legs: "dubious" for "tapeless" legs - bearing along continuation...

<li>legs: hydrology - fossil/active/not recorded/static water/underwater
(sump) [diving underwater by default? except style can mean altimeter
too...]

<li>legs: floor type - mud/sand/breakdown/flowstone/etc and can then used
LRUD to draw crude survey...

<li>legs: "commented out" flag?  syntax check data but otherwise ignore

<li>station flags: "important" - e.g. top camp "fixed" point /
junction,deadend (implied by order) /
articulation pt (know for nodes I think a station is if at least one
of its nodes is)

<li>Allow valid range for an instrument to be specified.  Tie in with
*instrument.  *units date - ranges for dates - e.g. "1990-" or
"jun-aug"...

<li>Maybe station lists should know how long they are?

<li>cope with any combination of readings which gives enough info ???

<li>Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation
points?

<li>leg and station "comments":

<pre>*data passage station left right up down comment

1 1.0 - 50+ 0.5 "large cairn"

2 ...

*data normal station l r u d comment newline tape compass clino

1 1.0 - 50+ 0.5 "large cairn"

  10.78 123 -03

2 ...
</pre>

comment can be omitted "-" or not present if at end of line...?
commentall?

<li>GPS support (e.g. export survey as GPS coords)

<li>print to an image file (use gd? or wxwidgets...)

<li>Allow covariances to be specified in cartesian style?

<li>grid on printouts
<ul>
<li>grid crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).
<li>[(x,y) of a point to go through (easting, northing)
<li>x spacing, y spacing (default to x spacing)
<li>orientation (bearing of y-axis?) (defaults to 0)]
</ul>

<li>Mark: "surface.png is for a textured landscape -- there needs to be a
menu option to select the texturing on/off, and this should be the
texture used. map.png is just a different surface overlay for Loser."

<li>Profile aven further (for both speed and memory usage)

<li>by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

<li>label junctions/dead ends?

<li>section colouring/selective labelling

<li>clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

<li>Some way to display all the names of an equated station (e.g. in pop-up
window or the info panel).
</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous Bugs</H2>

<ul>

<li>This gives "*** Singular!!!" warning with DEBUG_INVALID on:
<pre>
1 2 50000 0 -
1 2 5 0 -30
</pre>

<li>aven: loading a .3d file with no survey data (or which has a valid header but is broken later) with a survey already loaded doesn't work well.

<li>img.c: eliminate duplicate img_LABELs when reading .PLT files.

<li>multiple readings:
<p>
average bearings specially - they don't average like normal numbers
<p>
%age gradients should probably average the same as angle gradients
<p>
Document - works like so:
<pre>
*set open {
*set close }
*calibrate compass {000.5 001.0 001.25}
1 2 10.23 {000 001} -02
2 3 {10.16 10.17} 127 {+06 +05}
3 4 11.98 007 {+03 +03}
</pre>
Implement as extension to number format so any suitable numeric value to be
repeated?
</ul>

<H2>Aven</H2>

<ul>

<li>check on monochrome, 16, and 256 colour displays - especially that depth
colouring looks OK

<li>Feed back redraw time to key based movement as in caverot?  Or perhaps best
not to?  It depends on whether we expect people to hold down keys or not...
Perhaps something smart where the first press is a fixed size, then after that
it depends on the redraw?
</ul>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<ul>

<li>Platform specific versions of docs?

<li>Put more terms in terminology in docs ? trip, instrument, ...

<li>Finish off manual loose ends.

<li>Look at using docbook2man instead of docbook-to-man (command is
<i>nsgmls man_aven.sgml | sgmlspl /usr/lib/perl5/sgmlspl-specs/docbook2man-spec.pl</i>).  Issues are: double space between sentences is lost;
double blank lines appear in output.

<li>Make sure there's documentation for all the various settings in print.ini
(colours aren't documented at present)

</ul>

<H2>Survex file format</H2>

<ul>

<li>flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce points for a surface triangulation...

<li>?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

<li>comma separated dates in *date?

<li>Find a solution to Thilo's "." problem.

<li>Units in *fix (currently metres)

</ul>

<H2>Internationalisation and Localisation</H2>

<ul>

<li>quotes in messages - translate too? e.g. `XXX' to &laquo; XXX &raquo;.  Eric
suggests not in French.

<li>control of output units in .err file and in stats at end of cavern run?
In fact anywhere we report a value in degrees or metres, the units should be
selectable

</ul>

<H2>Test Suite</H2>

<ul>

<li>test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

<li>more tests for direction

<li>improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

<li>Compass .mak and .plt and CMAP .xyz in test suite?

<li>img.c: test routines in test suite?

</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<ul>

<li>resolve FIXMEs in code

<li>Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

<li>Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?  Beware of issues like those that revcomplist test checks.

<li>Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

<li>flag nosurvey legs in .3d file

<li>sort out title which goes in .3d file for this (if no *includes in ...
it gets the title of the leafname of this .svx file, otherwise it's the
leafnames of the *include-d files, comma-separated):

<pre>
*begin mycave
*title "My Cave"
...
*end mycave
</pre>

<li>make img more modular (convert to C++?)

<li>add support for .KST?  Gary says documentation is out of date, and recent
releases of winkarst have broken .KST export/import...

<li>resolve documentation/examples mismatch for station based .XYZ files and
implement reading of legs from them.

<li>diffpos: compare connectivity (i.e legs as well as stations) - e.g.

<pre>
foo.1 moved by (0.02, 0.10, -0.06)
leg between foo.1 and bar.2 removed
...
bar.2 moved by (-0.02, -0.05, 0.03)
</pre>

<li>improve .plt export to include less crude survey structure.

<li>look at solution by QR factorisation in matrix.c more

<li>consider disabling the more expensive asserts - turning them all off
speeds up cavern by about 10%.

<li>open aven, go full screen, Ctrl+O to open file, shows side panel while full
screen which we don't normally do...

<li>If multiple methods for drawing crosses and/or blobs pass the
visual fidelity check, check which is fastest.
</ul>
