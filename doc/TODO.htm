<H1>Survex To-Do List</H1>

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<ul>
<li>printdm - put standard scaling in print.ini for canon bj (prod Mark
to get numbers)

<li>If I pull the vertical border to left or right edge of window, I
lose a pane and don't appear to be able to get it back.  Perhaps "Restore
panes" menu option if we can't allow the pane to be dragged open
again...

<li>"Find station" should be case insensitive by default

<li>Make regexp work on unix and win32 or disable it for 1.0...

<li>Shift-ed keys should move faster (as they do in caverot)

<li>Ctrl-Up/Down to tilt; Ctrl-Left/Right to rotate?

<li>scale bar dragging is wrong - e.g. drag scalebar left then
back to right - on drag right zoom is initially in the wrong direction!

<li>This gives "*** Singular!!!" warning with DEBUG_INVALID on:
<pre>
1 2 50000 0 -
1 2 5 0 -30
</pre>

<li>possible mysterious problem with [ and ] not zooming to screen centre

<li>suppress warning box if wxWindows doesn't have translations in requested
language (doesn't appear to be possible)

<li>Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed... [from Mark: libgtk1.2 1.2.10-1 exhibits these symptoms]
[from Olly: installing "locales" package fixes this for me...]

<li>Close button in About box not in correct place (on MS Windows)

</ul>

<H2>Aven</H2>

<ul>

<li>clino needs resistance around 0

<li>finish reverse controls

<li>by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

<li>label junctions/dead ends?

<li>colour by traverse

<li>section colouring/selective labelling

<li>clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

<li>colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"aven --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

<li>check on monochrome displays - especially that depth colouring
looks OK

<li>Redraw time should feed back to step size (so small caves on
fast puters look sane, and so autorotate keeps an even speed when
little can be seen for part of each rotation)

</ul>

<H2>Printing</H2>

<ul>

<li>Check skip blank pages works (checked printps)...

</ul>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<ul>

<li>doc/manual.sgml has version number (0.99 currently) hardcoded.

<li>Platform specific versions of docs?

<li>Put more terms in terminology in docs ? trip, instrument, ...

<li>Move stuff about /etc/survex/print.ini from print.ini into manual
and put pointer in print.ini instead.

</ul>

<H2>Survex file format</H2>

<ul>

<li>flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce points for a surface triangulation...

<li>?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

<li>comma separated dates in *date?

<li>Allow "*exportall" or similar?  Leandro's point about "maze caves" -
just saying "don't use *export" is unhelpful if someone connects a
cave with *export to one without...

<li>Find a solution to Thilo's "." problem.

</ul>

<H2>Internationalisation</H2>

<ul>

<li>update translations

<li>extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

<li>quotes in messages - translate too? e.g. `XXX' to « XXX ».  Eric
suggests not in French.

<li>extract --help messages for translation.

<li>Check menu short-cuts don't clash in each translation...

</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<ul>

<li>chase up zombies again?

<li>resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

<li>Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

<li>Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?  Beware of issues like those that revcomplist test checks.

<li>Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

<li>test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

<li>tests for direction - should direction work in non-interleaved data?

<li>improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

<li>caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

<li>Retire survex wrapper (no-survex-wrapper.patch) for version 1.0.

<li>Allow extend (or printing of extend) to unfold right-left instead of
left to right?

<li>cylpolar with dz rather than depth?

<!--survex should be on official debian servers soon
 <li>survex apt source for survex and survex-aven...-->

<li>ISO image?  structure debian packages on it as an apt source.
autorun for MS Windows?

</ul>
