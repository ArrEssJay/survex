<H1>Survex To-Do List</H1>

<H2>Survex 1.0</H2>

<ul>

<li>printdm: put standard scaling in print.ini for canon bj (prod Mark
to get numbers)

<li>aven: scale bar dragging is wrong - e.g. drag scalebar left then
back to right - on drag right zoom is initially in the wrong direction!

<li>aven: Recheck menu short-cuts don't clash in each translation (automate?)

<li>Retire survex wrapper (no-survex-wrapper.patch) for version 1.0.

<li>Tree control selection bug (Mark knows details and is investigating).

<li>Make Escape cancel measuring line on MS Windows.

<li>Look at enabling NT 3.51 support in MS Windows installer.

<li>Look at cleaning out incorrect registry keys installed by older MS
Windows installers.

<li>Look at installing on NT, etc when not administrator (or disallow
it for now if we can't get it to work easily).

<li>Finish off manual loose ends.

<li>Check mail backlog...

</ul>

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<ul>

<li>If I pull the vertical border to left or right edge of window, I
lose a pane and don't appear to be able to get it back.  Perhaps "Restore
panes" menu option if we can't allow the pane to be dragged open
again...

<li>Shift-ed keys should move faster in aven/xcaverot (as they do in caverot)

<li>This gives "*** Singular!!!" warning with DEBUG_INVALID on:
<pre>
1 2 50000 0 -
1 2 5 0 -30
</pre>

<li>possible mysterious problem with [ and ] not zooming to screen centre

</ul>

<H2>Aven</H2>

<ul>

<li>clino needs resistance around 0

<li>finish reverse controls

<li>by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

<li>label junctions/dead ends?

<li>colour by traverse

<li>section colouring/selective labelling

<li>clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

<li>colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"aven --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

<li>check on monochrome displays - especially that depth colouring
looks OK

<li>Redraw time should feed back to step size (so small caves on
fast puters look sane, and so autorotate keeps an even speed when
little can be seen for part of each rotation)

<li>Some way to display all the names of an equated station (e.g. in pop-up
window or the info panel).

<li>Highlight a whole survey by clicking on it in the tree...

</ul>

<H2>Printing</H2>

<ul>

<li>Check skip blank pages works (checked printps)...

</ul>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<ul>

<li>doc/manual.sgml has version number (0.99 currently) hardcoded.

<li>Platform specific versions of docs?

<li>Put more terms in terminology in docs ? trip, instrument, ...

</ul>

<H2>Survex file format</H2>

<ul>

<li>flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce points for a surface triangulation...

<li>?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

<li>comma separated dates in *date?

<li>Allow "*exportall" or similar?  Leandro's point about "maze caves" -
just saying "don't use *export" is unhelpful if someone connects a
cave with *export to one without...

<li>Find a solution to Thilo's "." problem.

</ul>

<H2>Internationalisation</H2>

<ul>

<li>update translations

<li>extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

<li>quotes in messages - translate too? e.g. `XXX' to « XXX ».  Eric
suggests not in French.

<li>extract --help messages for translation.

</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<ul>

<li>resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

<li>Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

<li>Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?  Beware of issues like those that revcomplist test checks.

<li>Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

<li>test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

<li>tests for direction - should direction work in non-interleaved data?

<li>improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

<li>caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

<li>Allow extend (or printing of extend) to unfold right-left instead of
left to right?

<li>ISO image?  structure debian packages on it as an apt source.
autorun for MS Windows?

</ul>
