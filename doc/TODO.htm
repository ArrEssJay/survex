<H1>Survex To-Do List</H1>

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<ul>
<li>This gives "*** Singular!!!" warning with DEBUG_INVALID on:
<pre>
1 2 50000 0 -
1 2 5 0 -30
</pre>

<li>After *solve, reused points get written to the .3d file again.  This
is pretty harmless, but untidy.

<li>Aven presentation recording crashes if you select the "Finish and
Save" menu item twice.

<li>Fix aven scaling crash

<li>Load a .pos file and no stations are shown - I think the problem
is in aven, as img looks to be setting the station "underground" flag...

</ul>

<H2>Aven</H2>

<ul>

<li>Profile aven (for speed and memory usage)

<li>clino needs resistance around 0

<li>scale bar dragging factor needs slight tweak

<li>finish reverse controls

<li>possible mysterious problem with [ and ] not zooming to screen centre

<li>suppress warning box if wxWindows doesn't have translations in requested
language (doesn't appear to be possible)

<li>continuing trouble with accelerator keys

<li>Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed... [from Mark: libgtk1.2 1.2.10-1 exhibits these symptoms]

<li>releasing drag over menubar doesn't send event properly

<li>Close button in About box not in correct place (on MS Windows)

<li>"[", "]", "'", and "/" accelerators don't work (on MS Windows 98)

<li>trouble with zooming in too far on wxaven for GTK (xcaverot too)

<li>by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

<li>click on station to centre; type in station to centre

<li>label junctions/dead ends?

<li>colour by traverse

<li>section colouring/selective labelling

<li>clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

<li>shift-ed keys should move faster (as they do in caverot)

<li>colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"aven --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

<li>check on monochrome displays - especially that depth colouring
looks OK

<li>Redraw time should feed back to step size (so small caves on
fast puters look sane, and so autorotate keeps an even speed when
little can be seen for part of each rotation)

<li>glcaverot features - perspective view and depth fogging...

<li>Mark: "surface.png is for a textured landscape -- there needs to be a
menu option to select the texturing on/off, and this should be the
texture used. map.png is just a different surface overlay for Loser."

<li>Remould presentation recording into the more usual "New"/"Save
As"/"Load"/"Save" mould

</ul>

<H2>Printing</H2>

<ul>

<li>Check skip blank pages works on print*...

<li>/etc/survex/example.print.ini ?

</ul>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<ul>

<li>doc/manual.sgml has version number (0.99 currently) hardcoded.

<li>Platform specific versions of docs?

<li>Put more terms in terminology in docs ? trip, instrument, ...

</ul>

<H2>Survex file format</H2>

<ul>

<li>flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce points for a surface triangulation...

<li>?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

<li>comma separated dates in *date?

<li>Allow "*exportall" or similar?  Leandro's point about "maze caves" -
just saying "don't use *export" is unhelpful if someone connects a
cave with *export to one without...

<li>Find a solution to Thilo's "." problem.

</ul>

<H2>Internationalisation</H2>

<ul>

<li>update translations

<li>extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

<li>How to select alternative language on MS Windows - setting env
vars isn't easy win install lang??

<li>quotes in messages - translate too? e.g. `XXX' to « XXX ».  Eric
suggests not in French.

<li>extract --help messages for translation.

<li>Check menu short-cuts don't clash in each translation...

</ul>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<ul>

<li>chase up zombies again?

<li>resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

<li>Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

<li>Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?  Beware of issues like those that revcomplist test checks.

<li>Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

<li>test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

<li>tests for direction - should direction work in non-interleaved data?

<li>improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

<li>caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

<li>Retire survex wrapper (no-survex-wrapper.patch) for version 1.0.

<li>Allow extend (or printing of extend) to unfold right-left instead of
left to right?

<li>cylpolar with dz rather than depth?

<li>survex apt source for survex, survex-aven, and wxgtk2.2 so apt-get
survex will work on potato...

<li>ISO image?  structure debian packages on it as an apt source.
autorun for MS Windows?

</ul>
