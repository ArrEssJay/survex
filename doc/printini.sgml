<refsect2><Title>Printer Settings</Title>

<Para>The format of the
<filename>print.ini</filename>/<filename>myprint.ini</filename>
file is similar to Windows <filename/.ini/ files.
There is a section name in square
brackets, e.g.:
</Para>

<programlisting>[generic_PCL]</programlisting>

<Para>and there are some options and settings below that of the form
</Para>

<Para>&lt;option&gt;=&lt;setting&gt;
</Para>

<Para>e.g.:</Para>

<programlisting>pixels_across_page=960</programlisting>

<Para>below each of this options is usually a comment (indicated by a
semicolon ';') saying what the option above is for. The codes needed by dot
matrix printers are given as they are usually shown in manuals. The
backslash '\' indicating that the following character is to be interpreted
as a control code so \[ means send the value 27 decimal which is 1B hex,
also called 'ESC' for Escape. If the backslash is followed by a small x and
two hex digits - e.g \x0c, then that means send the code 0C hex, which is 12
decimal, also called LF for LineFeed. This is all inherently rather
cryptic, but the provided set-ups will work with nearly all dot matrix
printers, so you are unlikely to need to fiddle with these runes.
</Para>

<Para>
The only thing most users will have to specify is the output device
(and Calibration for Dot Matrix Printers, see 'Printer Calibration').
This is the setting given in the [base] section of the form
output_&lt;platform&gt=&lt;device&gt;, where device can be a device name
(e.g. PRN, LPT1, LPT2 under &msdos;, <filename/Printer:/ under &riscos;) or a
filename. Under &unix; output may be piped into another command like
so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
[base]
output_unix=|lpr -Poak
; send output to printer 'oak'</programlisting>

<Para>
Any name given which is not recognised as a device will generate a
file of that name, containing the exact data that would be sent to the
printer. This can then be send to a printer later (See the note above
from &msdos; users). You can override the output setting using the
--output command line option.
</Para>

<Para>Each type of printer has its own section. The basic types provides
are:
</Para>

<Para>[DM] (for Dot Matrix, PRINTDM).[HPGL] (for HPGL plotters, PRNTHPGL),
[PCL] (for PCL printers PRINTPCL), and [PS] (for Postscript printers), and
for each of these types at least one specific example is provided, for the
specified printer and paper size.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME: check this -->

<Para>The examples provided are: [dm_8pin_a4] [dm_8pin_11inch],
[dm_8pin_12inch], [dm_9pin_11inch], [dm_9pin_12inch], [dm_24pin_a4],
[dm_24pin_11inch], [dm_24pin_12inch], [dm_panasonic_24pin],
[dm_epsonlx86_9pin_11inch]
</Para>

<Para>[hpgl_generic_a4landscape], [hpgl_generic_A1landscape],
[hpgl_generic_A0landscape]
</Para>

<Para>[pcl_generic_a4], [pcl_modern_a4]
</Para>

<Para>[ps_generic_a4]
</Para>

<Para>The idea is that your printer can be defined in terms of an existing
one, using the 'like' option. This makes the settings for the specified
printer include the settings specified in the 'like' section, except where
they are overridden by new settings in this section. The syntax is
Like=&lt;definition name&gt;, where definition name must have been
previously defined in the file.
</Para>

<Para>Here is an example of how it works:
</Para>

<programlisting>
[dm_9pin_12inch]
Like=dm_11inch_9pin
Lines_down_page=108</programlisting>

<Para>So this means that the definition 'dm_9pin_12inch', i.e. 9pin dot
matrix printer using 12 inch paper, is just like the 11 inch definition for
the same printer, except for the number of lines down a page.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME: fettle this -->
<Para>If you find that your printout does not come out correctly, then the
best way to make changes for your printer is to create a new section called
[my_printer], and start with a like=something where something is the closest
section to your printer. Then add new options to override the ones that are
not correct for your printer. Finally you need to change the section for the
type of printer you are using to point to your new definition. E.g. if you
are using a dot-matrix printer then you need to change the [DM] section to
say like=my_printer .
</Para>

<Para>Note that if you are using a PCL printer the defaults are set
not to use advanced printer features for compatibility. If you want to
try these (equivalent to HP laserjet III or later), then you should
change the [PCL] section to say like=modern_pcl_a4 . This will enable
horizontal and vertical tabbing.
</Para>
