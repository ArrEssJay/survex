<Para>
Extend starts with the highest station marked as an entrance which
has at least one underground survey leg attached to it.  If there are
no such stations, the highest deadend station in the survey (or the
highest station if there are no deadends) is used.  Extend puts the#
first station on the left, then folds each leg out individually to the right,
breaking loops arbitrarily (usually at junctions).</Para>

<Para>
This approach suffices for simple caves or sections of cave.
for more complicated situations human intervention is required -
try &chasm;'s extended elevation editor (which we plan to integrate
into Survex in the future).</Para>

<Para>If the output filename is not specified, extend writes its
output to <filename/extend.3d/.</Para>
