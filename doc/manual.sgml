</Para>

<Para>*EQUATE is used to join surveys together, e.g.
</Para>

<programlisting>*equate entrance.6 adrian.1</programlisting>

<Para>
indicates that station 6 of the entrance survey was used as
the station 1 of the Adrian's Route survey.
</Para>

<Para>*FIX is for fixing control points - for example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*fix 161.entrance.1    0  0  1780</programlisting>

<Para>fixes the 1st point of the 'entrance' survey at the coordinates
0 (east-west), 0 (north-south), 1780 (altitude).
</Para>


<term>node</term>
<listitem><para>when talking about the survey network, we talk about an
<emphasis>n</emphasis>-node to describe the number of connections to
a station.  So a 1-node is a station with only 1 leg to or from it
- i.e. The end of a passage or survey. A
2-node is a typical station along a passage with a survey leg coming
into it, and one going out.  A 3-node is a station with three legs
joining it, e.g. at a T-junction. And so on.

  <Abstract>
   <Para>
    This is the manual for &survexsuite; - an open-source software package for
    cave surveyors.
   </Para>
  </Abstract>
 </articleinfo>

<Sect1><Title>Introduction</Title>
<?dbhtml filename="intro.htm">

<Para>
This section describes what &survexsuite; is, and outlines the scope of this
manual.
</Para>

<Sect2><Title>About &survexsuite;</Title>

<Para>&survexsuite; is a multi-platform open-source cave surveying
package.
currently runs on &unix;, Microsoft Windows 95/NT and
successors, Mac OS X, &msdos;, and Acorn &riscos; machines.
We're investigating support for various
palmtop devices.
</Para>

<Para>We are well aware that not everyone has access to super hardware
- often surveying projects are run on little or no budget and any
computers used are donated.  We aim to ensure that &survexsuite; is
feasible to use on low-spec machines.  Obviously it won't be as
responsive, but we intend it to be usable.
Please help us to achieve this by giving us some feedback
if you use &survexsuite; on a slow machine.</Para>

<Para>&survexsuite; is capable of processing extremely complex caves very
quickly and has a very effective, real-time cave viewer which allows
you to rotate, zoom, and pan the cave using mouse or keyboard. We have
tested it extensively using &cucc; and &arge;'s surveys of the caves
under the Loser Plateau in Austria (over 11,500 survey legs, and over
66km of underground survey data). This can all be processed in a few
seconds on a low-end <hardware>Pentium</hardware> machine.
Survex is also used by many other survey projects around the world,
including the 
<ulink url="http://www.oucc.org.uk/draenen/draenenmain.htm"
>Ogof Draenen</ulink> survey, the 
<ulink url="http://www.easegill.org.uk/">Easegill</ulink> resurvey project,
the <Acronym/OFD/ survey, the 
<!-- url="http://milos2.zoo.ox.ac.uk/~oucc/reports/surveys/surveys.htm" -->
<ulink url="http://www.oucc.org.uk/reports/surveys/surveys.htm"
><Acronym/OUCC/ Picos expeditions</ulink>, and the 
<ulink url="http://www.hongmeigui.net/">Hong Meigui China
expeditions</ulink>. <!-- FIXME more? --></Para>

<Para>&survexsuite; is still actively being worked on.  Version 1.0 is
complete in some sense, but development continues - initially in reshaping
Survex into a more integrated GUI package.</Para>

<Para>We encourage feedback from users on important features or problems,
which will help to direct future development. Contact addresses are at the
end of this manual.</Para>

</Sect2>

<!--
<Para>Because &survexsuite; is still being actively developed, this document
has an unfortunate tendency to lag slightly behind the capabilities of the
software. The latest version is now available on the web at <ulink
url="&survexwebsite;">&survexwebsite;</ulink> - check there for latest info.

<Sect2><Title>About this Manual</Title>

<Para>
If there's a part of this manual you find hard to understand, please do
let us know.  We already know Survex well, so it can be hard for us
to spot areas where the manual doesn't given enough information, or
doesn't explain things clearly enough to follow when you don't know what's
going on.  It's helpful is you can suggest a better wording, but don't worry
if you can't, just explain the problem as precisely as you can.
</Para>

<Para>
The master version of this manual is an <acronym>SGML</acronym>
document written using the <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/">docbook
<acronym>DTD</acronym></ulink>,
and automatically converted to a number of other formats.  If
you are going to send us <emphasis>major</emphasis> changes, it's much easier
to include them if you work from this master.  You can get it
from the source archive (docs/manual.sgml) or from <ulink
url="http://www.survex.com/docs.html">the Survex website</ulink>.

<!-- FIXME: Further sources of info: website, mailing lists, other docs -->

</Sect1>

<Sect1><Title>Getting Started</Title>
<?dbhtml filename="getstart.htm">

<Para>This section covers how to obtain the software, and how to unpack and
install it, and how to configure it.</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Obtaining &survexsuite;</Title>

<Para>The latest version is available from the &survexsuite; website:
<ulink url="&survexwebsite;">&survexwebsite;</ulink>. If you do not
have internet access or would prefer to get a copy by post, we are
also happy to send out up-to-date copies on a floppy on receipt of
a stamped, self-addressed envelope. See the end of this
document for addresses.</Para>

<Para>
There's also a CD containing versions of &survexsuite; for every supported
platform.  You can download an image for this from the website, or we'll
send you a copy on a CD-R if you send us money to cover the costs.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Installing &survexsuite;</Title>

<Para>The details of installation depend greatly on what platform you
are using, so there is a separate section below for each platform.</Para>

<Sect3><Title>&linux;</Title>

<Para>
We supply pre-compiled versions for x86 &linux; machines in RPM format
(suitable for Redhat, Mandrake, and some other distributions).
Survex Debian packages are available from Debian mirror sites in
the usual way.
</Para>

<Para>
You'll need root access to install these prebuilt packages.
If you don't have root access you will need to build from source
(see the next section).
</Para>

<!-- FIXME Add Gnome file association note for Linux/Unix
<Para>On Microsoft Windows and &riscos; &survexsuite; installs with
suitable file associations so that you can drive it from the GUI.
On &unix; and &msdos; you need to drive &survexsuite; from a command-line
prompt (or set some a filemanager or graphics shell).
</Para>
-->

<Sect3><Title>Other versions of &unix;</Title>

<Para>For other &unix; versions you'll need to get the source code
and compile it on your system.  &survexsuite; uses GNU automake
and autoconf to streamline the compile process, so all you need to do
is unpack the sources, then simply type <userinput>./configure</userinput>
followed by <userinput>make</userinput> to build the programs and then
<userinput>make install</userinput> to install them.</Para>

<Note>
<Para>
If you're building to install in your home directory (for example
if you don't have root access on the machine you wish to install
&survexsuite; on) configure and build with
<userinput>./configure --prefix=/home/olly/survex</userinput> then
<userinput>make</userinput> to build and
<userinput>make install</userinput> to install.
</Para>
</Note>

<Para>
There's a GUI cave viewer called aven, which needs &wxwidgets; to build,
which in turn needs Gtk+ (or Motif or just X11, but we only regularly
test with the Gtk+ version).
</Para>

<!-- FIXME: recommend printps on &UNIX; (or just &linux;)??? -->

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>Microsoft Windows 95/NT and successors</Title>

<Para>
This version comes packaged with an installation wizard.  Just
run the downloaded package and it will lead you through the
installation process.  If installing on MS Windows NT, 2000, or XP
we recommend you run the installer as administrator (or as a
user with administrator rights) so that the file associations
can be set up for all users.
</Para>

<Para>
This version includes a GUI cave survey viewer called aven, and a
Survex printer driver (printwin) which uses the Windows printer
system.
</Para>

<Para>
The installer creates a Survex group in the Programs sub-menu of the
Start menu containing the following items:
</Para>

<ItemizedList>

<ListItem><Para>Aven</Para></ListItem>

<ListItem><Para>Documentation</Para></ListItem>

<ListItem><Para>Uninstall Survex</Para></ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

<Para>
Icons are installed for &svx;, &x3d;, &err;, and &pos; files, and also for
Compass Plot files (<filename>.plt</filename> and <filename>.plf</filename>)
(which Survex can read). <!-- FIXME XYZ -->
Double-clicking on a &svx; file processes it to produce a &x3d; file.
Double-clicking the &x3d; file views it in aven.
You can also right click on these files to bring up a menu of other possible

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>MS Windows 3.1 and &msdos; (Intel 80386 or newer CPU)</Title>

<Para>For MS Windows 3.1 we suggest using the &msdos; version.
This version is compiled with the free DJGPP C compiler
(<ulink url="&djgppwebsite;">&djgppwebsite;</ulink>) which uses &dpmi;
to access memory above &msdos;'s 640k. Windows has &dpmi; services built in,
as do QEMM and Novell DOS 7.
For those situations where &dpmi; services aren't available, we
include the free <filename>cwsdpmi.exe</filename>, which will be used
automatically if it's needed.</Para>
</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>&msdos; (Intel 80286 or earlier CPU)</Title>

<Para>We also supply a version suitable for use on pre-386 machines. You
might wonder why - the reason is that many surveying projects have little
or no budget and can acquire such machines for free. This version is
suitable for caves up to medium size - a few thousand stations - which
typically equates to a few kilometres of survey.  A very loopy cave may
need more memory.
</Para>

<Para>This version is built with <Application/Borland C/.
A feature of this is that the best way to force a program to
terminate is with <keycap/Ctrl-Break/. <keycap/Ctrl-C/ sometimes works,
but is less reliable.</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>&riscos;</Title>

<Para>
&survexsuite; for &riscos; comes in a zip archive.  Installation is
just a matter of opening the archive with
<application>!SparkPlug</application>,
<application>!SparkFS</application>, or
similar and dragging the contents to where you want them installed.
This version is known to work with RISC OS 3.1 or newer.  We are unable to test
compatibility with earlier versions of RISC OS.
</Para>

</Sect3>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Configuration</Title>

<Sect3><Title>Selecting Your Preferred Language</Title>

<Para>Survex has extensive internationalisation capabilities.  The
language used for messages from Survex and most of the library calls
it uses can be changed.  By default this is picked up from the
language the operating system is set to use (from "Regional Settings"
in Control Panel on Microsoft Windows, from the
<systemitem>LANG</systemitem> environment variable on &unix;, from the
value passed to <systemitem>COUNTRY</systemitem> in
<filename>CONFIG.SYS</filename> on MSDOS (but this doesn't
distinguish between the different languages used in a country in most
cases), or from the configured Territory on &riscos;). If no setting
is found, or &survexsuite; hasn't been translated into the
requested language, UK English is used.</Para>

<Para>
However you may want to override the language manually -
for example if Survex isn't available in your native language
you'll want to choose the supported language you understand best.
</Para>

<Para>
To do this, you set the
<systemitem>SURVEXLANG</systemitem> environment variable.  Here's a list
of the codes currently supported:</Para>

<informaltable frame="all">
<tgroup cols="2">

messages in French (language code fr):</Para>

<VariableList>
 <VarListEntry><Term>&msdos;</Term>
   <ListItem><Para>Put <command>SET SURVEXLANG=fr</command> in your
<filename>AUTOEXEC.BAT</filename> script.  You will need to restart
&msdos; before it notices this setting - to set it for the current
&msdos; session enter <command>SET SURVEXLANG=fr</command> at the MSDOS
command prompt.</Para></ListItem>
 </VarListEntry>
 <VarListEntry><Term>Microsoft Windows</Term>
   <ListItem><Para>
For MS Windows 95 and 98 (and probably ME), you'll need to add a line to
<filename>AUTOEXEC.BAT</filename> as for MSDOS (see above).  You need to
reboot for the change to take effect.
</Para>

<Para>For MS Windows NT4, 2000, and XP, you should proceed as follows
(this description is written from MS Windows 2000 - it should be similar on
NT4 and XP): Open the Start Menu, navigate to the Settings sub-menu, and
open Control Panel.  Open System (picture of a computer) and click on the
Advanced tab.  Choose `Environmental Variables', and create a new one: name
<systemitem>SURVEXLANG</systemitem>, value <systemitem>fr</systemitem>.
Click OK and the new value should be effective immediately.

again and double-click on <filename>!Boot</filename>.  Edit the line
which says <SystemItem>Set SurvexLang en</SystemItem> and change the
value to the code for the language you want from the table above.
Save the file, and double-click on <filename>!Boot</filename>.
This sets the language for all the &survexsuite; programs.
   </Para></ListItem>
 </VarListEntry>
</VariableList>

<Para>If &survexsuite; isn't available in your language, you could
help out by providing a translation.  The initial translation is
likely to be about a day's work; after that translations for
new or changed messages are occasionally required.  Contact us for details
if you're interested.</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>Configuring the Printer Drivers</Title>

<Para>
On Microsoft Windows, we recommend you print using printwin which uses
the built in drivers and so requires no separate configuration - if you
can print from other programs, you can print from Survex.  The only
thing you may want to configure is the colours used if you have a colour
printer.
</Para>

<Para>
The drivers used for other platforms may require a small amount of
configuration, which is described in the following section.

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Short and Long Options</Title>

<Para>
Options have two forms: short (a dash followed by a single letter e.g.
<command/cavern -p/) and long (two dashes followed by one or more words e.g.
<command/cavern --percentage/).  The long form is generally easier to
remember, while the short form is quicker to type.  Options are often
available in both forms.
</Para>

<Note><Para>Command line options are case sensitive, so "-B" and "-b"
are different (this didn't used to be the case before Survex 0.90).  Case
sensitivity doubles the number of available short options (and is also the
norm on &unix;).
</Para></Note>
</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Filenames on the Command Line</Title>

<Para>Filenames with spaces can be processed (provided your operating system
supports them - &unix; does, and so do recent versions of Microsoft
Windows).  You need to enclose the filename in quotes like so:
<userinput>cavern "Spider Cave"</userinput>
</Para>

<Para>A file specified on the command line of any of the &survexsuite; suite
of programs will be looked for as specified.  If it is not found, then the
file is looked for with the appropriate extension appended.  So
<userinput>cavern survey</userinput> will look first for
<filename>survey</filename>, then for <filename>survey.svx</filename>.

<?dbhtml filename="datafile.htm">

<Para>Survey data is entered in the form of text files. You can use any
text editor you like for this, so long as it has the capability of
writing a plain ASCII text file. The data format is very flexible;
unlike some other cave surveying software, Survex does not require
survey legs to be rearranged to suit the computer, and the ordering 
of instrument readings on each line is fully specifiable.  So you can enter
your data much as it appears on the survey notes, which is important
in reducing the opportunities for transcription errors.
</Para>

<Para>
Also all the special characters are user-definable - for example,
the separators can be spaces and tabs, or commas (e.g. when exporting from a
spreadsheet), etc; the decimal point can be a slash (for clarity), a comma
(as used in continental Europe), or anything else you care to choose.
This flexibility
means that it should be possible to read in data from almost any sort of
survey data file without much work.
</Para>

<Para>&survexsuite; places no restrictions on you in terms of the ordering
of survey legs. You can enter or process data in any order and &survexsuite; will
read it all in before determining how it is connected. You can also use the
hierarchical naming so that you do not need to worry about using the same
station name twice.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME don't encourage separate processing -->
<Para>The usual arrangement is to have one file which lists all the others
that are included (e.g., <filename/161.svx/). Then
<command/cavern 161/ will process all your data. To just process a
section use the filename for that section, e.g. <command/cavern dtime/
will process the dreamtime file/section of Kaninchenh&ouml;hle.  To
help you out, if all legs in a survey are connected to one another
but the survey has no fixed points, cavern
will 'invent' a fixed point and print a warning message to this
effect.
</Para>

<Para>
It is up to you what data you put in which files.  You
can have one file per trip, or per area of the cave, or just one
file for the whole cave if you like.
On a large survey project it makes sense to group related surveys in the
same file or directory.
</Para>
<!-- FIXME: wook sez:

 Point out in documentation that file structure and survey structure don't
 have to be the same.  And in particular that folder/directory names can be
 different.

Which is partly covered above, though the last bit isn't...

<!-- FIXME "Anatomy of a Survey" section -->
<Sect2><Title>Readings</Title>

<Para>Blank lines (i.e. lines consisting solely of BLANK characters)
are ignored. The last line in the file need not be terminated by
an end of line character. All fields on a line must be separated
by at least one BLANK character. An OMIT character
(default '-') indicates that a field is unused. If the field is
not optional, then an error is given.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Survey Station Names</Title>

<Para>&survexsuite; has a powerful system for naming stations.  It
uses a hierarchy of survey names, similar to the nested folders
your computer stores files in.
So point 6 in the entrance survey of Kaninchenh&ouml;hle
(cave number 161) is referred to as: 161.entrance.6
</Para>

<Para>This seems a natural way to refer to station names.  It also
means that it is very easy to include more levels, for example if you
want to plot all the caves in the area you just list them all in
another file, specifying a new prefix.  So to group 3 nearby caves
on the Loser Plateau you would use a file like
this:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin Loser
*include 161
*include 2YrGest
*include 145
*end Loser</programlisting>

<Para>
The entrance series point mentioned above would now be referred
to as: Loser.161.entrance.6
</Para>

<!--
<Para>This may seem a tad complex but is really very natural once you
get the hang of it.
</Para>
-->
<Para>You do not have to use this system at all, and can just give all
stations unique identifiers if you like:
</Para>

<Para>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 1381, 1382
</Para>

<Para>or
</Para>

<!-- FIXME:

<Para>Station and survey names may contain any alphanumeric characters and
additionally any characters in NAMES (default `_' and `-'). Alphabetic
characters may be forced to upper or lower case by using the *case
command. Station names may be any length - if you want to only treat
the first few characters as significant you can get cavern to truncate
the names using the *truncate command.

<!-- FIXME - work this text in here or elsewhere

What I mean (though failed to express very well) is that a dataset without
this information isn't the same dataset (in general anyway).  For example:

A1 a2 10.32 140 -05
a2 a3  4.91 041 -01
a1 a3  7.01 206  02

is either a traverse of 3 legs or a (probably badly misclosed) loop.  If
these names are on the original survey notes, the surveyors ought to say
whether "A1" is the same as "a1" (although the usual case for using this
feature is probably for importing data from elsewhere).  Similarly for
truncation.  Whether a clino of +/-90 degrees (or +/-100 grad, etc) is
interpreted as a plumb is something that should have been noted in the cave
(unless it's implicit because it's standard practice for a survey project).

It's a similar issue to calibration data in many ways.  You can argue it's
not part of "the survey", but without it the survey won't be the same shape,
and it's not useful to process the same survey with different settings for
compass calibration or name case sensitivity.

>Clearly that is unhelpfully strict, but it is

Think of the lines starting with a "*" as "command or meta-data".

-C has always had 3 settings - "leave case alone", "force to lower", and
"force to upper".  It doesn't really mean "case sensitivity" but rather
something like "case processing".  So you can usefully change it during a
run.  So if my dataset treats "NoTableChamber" (so named because it was
lacking in furniture) as different from "NotableChamber" (which was notable
for other reasons) I can process it with a dataset from someone else which
needs to be treated as case insensitive like so:

*begin my_cave
*include my_dataset
*end my_cave

*equate my_cave.NoTableChamber.14 your_cave.linkpassage.13

*begin your_cave
*case tolower
*include your_dataset
*end your_cave

You may be thinking of -U<n>, which used to mean "only compare the first n
characters of station names", but that doesn't allow arbitrary datasets to
be processed together.

So we changed it to mean "truncate station names to n characters", and
allowed it to be changed at any point, rather than being set once for the
whole run.

be interleaved - for example:

If the position is omitted it defaults to (0,0,0). <!-- which allows
sub-sections of a large survey to be easily processed separately.
 FIXME - don't want to encourage people to do this really -->
The standard errors default to zero (fix station exactly). cavern will
give an error if you attempt to fix the same survey station twice
at different coordinates, or a warning if you fix it twice with matching
coordinates.
</Para>

<Para>
You can also specify just one standard error (in which case it is assumed
equal in X, Y, and Z) or two (in which case the first is taken as the
standard error in X and Y, and the second as the standard error in Z).
</Para>

<Para>
If you have covariances for the fix, you can also specify these - the
order is cov(x,y) cov(y,z) cov(z,x). 
</Para>

<Para>
You can fix as many stations as you like - just use a *fix command for each
one.  Cavern will check that all stations are connected to
at least one fixed point so that co-ordinates can be calculated for all
stations.
</Para>

<Para>
By default cavern will warn about stations which have been FIX-ed but
not used otherwise.  This is unhelpful if you want to include a
standard file of benchmarks, some of which won't be used.
In this sort of situation, specify "REFERENCE" after the station name
in the FIX command to suppress this warning for a particular station.
</Para>

<Note><Para>
X is Easting, Y is Northing, and Z is altitude.  This convention was chosen
since on a map, the horizontal (X) axis is usually East, and the vertical
axis (Y) North.  The choice of altitude (rather than depth) for Z is taken
from surface maps, and makes for less confusion when dealing with cave
systems with more than one entrance.  It also gives a right-handed
set of axes.

obscure historical reasons) which is that the survey prefix is
restored upon return to the original file.  Since *begin and *end
nesting cannot cross files, this can only make a difference if you
use the deprecated *prefix command.

</Para>

<Para>An included file which does not have a complete path
is resolved relative to the directory which the parent file is in
(just as relative HTML links do).  Cavern will try adding a &svx;
extension, and will also try translating "\" to "/"
(or other appropriate tricks on RISC OS).  And as a last
resort, it will try a lower case version of the filename (so if you
use Unix and someone sends you a DOS/Windows dataset with mismatched
case, unzip it with "unzip -L" and unix cavern will process it).
</Para>

<Para>
The depth to which you can nest
include files may be limited by the operating system
you use.  Usually the limit is fairly high (>30), but if you want to be able to
process your dataset with &survexsuite; on any supported platform, it
would be prudent not to go overboard with nested include files.

being applied to them.

"0.05 metres", or "0.02 degrees". See *units below for full list

</Para>

<!-- FIXME mention central limit theorem -->
<Para>
To utilise this command fully you need to understand what a
<emphasis>standard deviation</emphasis> is.
It gives a value to the 'spread' of the errors
in a measurement. Assuming that these are normally distributed
we can say that 95.44% of the actual lengths will fall within two
standard deviations of the measured length. i.e. a tape SD of
0.25 metres means that the actual length of a tape measurement
is within + or - 0.5 metres of the recorded value 95.44% of the time.
So if the measurement is 7.34m then the actual length is very
likely to be between 6.84m and 7.84m. This example corresponds
to BCRA grade 3. Note that this is just one interpretation of
the BCRA standard, taking the permitted error values as 2SD 95.44%
confidence limits. If you want to take the readings as being some
other limit (e.g. 1SD = 68.26%) then you will need to change the BCRA3
and BCRA5 files accordingly. This issue is explored in more
detail in various surveying articles.

<?dbhtml filename="svxhowto.htm">

<Para>
Here is some example &survexsuite; data (a very small cave numbered 1623/163):
</Para>

<programlisting>
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5</programlisting>

<Para>
You can vary the data ordering.  The default is:
</Para>

<Para>
from-station to-station tape compass clino
</Para>

<Para>
This data demonstrates a number of useful features of &survexsuite;:
</Para>

<Para>
Legs can be measured either way round, which allows the use of
techniques like "leap-frogging" (which is where legs
alternate forwards and backwards).
</Para>

<Para>
Also notice that there is a spur in the survey (2 to 3).  You
do not need to specify this specially.
</Para>

<Para>
&survexsuite; places few restrictions on station naming (see "Survey
Station Names" in the previous section), so you can number the stations
as they were in the original survey notes.  Although not apparent from
this example, there is no requirement for each leg to connect to an
existing station.  &survexsuite; can accept data in any order, and will
check for connectedness once all the data has been read in.
</Para>

<Para>
Each survey is also likely to have other information associated
with it, such as instrument calibrations, etc.  This has been
omitted from this example to keep things simple.
</Para>

<Para>
Most caves will take more than just one survey trip to map.  Commonly
the numbering in each survey will begin at 1, so we need to be
able to tell apart stations with the same number in different
surveys.
</Para>

<Para>
To accomplish this, &survexsuite; has a very flexible system of hierarchical
prefixes.  All you need do is give each survey a unique name or
number, and enter the data like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin 163
*export 1
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5
*end 163</programlisting>

<Para>&survexsuite; will name the stations by attaching the current prefix.
In this case, the stations will be named 163.1, 163.2, etc.
</Para>

<Para>We have a convention with the CUCC Austria data that the entrance survey
station of a cave is named P&lt;cave number&gt;, P163 in this case. We
can accomplish this like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*equate P163 163.1
*entrance P163
*begin 163
*export 1
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
4 5  2.98  - DOWN
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5
*end 163</programlisting>

<Sect2><Title>Specify surface survey data</Title>

<Para>
Say you have 2 underground surveys and 2 surface ones with 2 fixed reference
points.  You want to mark the surface surveys so that their length isn't
included in length statistics, and so that Aven knows to display them
differently.  To do this you mark surface data with the "surface" flag
- this is set with "*flags surface" like so:
<Para>

<programlisting>
; fixed reference points
*fix fix_a 12345 56789 1234
*fix fix_b 23456 67890 1111                                                     
                                                                                
; surface data (enclosed in *begin ... *end to stop the *flags command
; from "leaking" out)
*begin
*flags surface
*include surface1
*include surface2
*end                                                                            
                                                                                
; underground data
*include cave1
*include cave2</programlisting>

<Para>
You might also have a survey which starts on the surface and heads into a
cave.  This can be easily handled too - here's an example which goes in
one entrance, through the cave, and out of another entrance:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin BtoC
*title "161b to 161c"
*date 1990.08.06 ; trip 1990-161c-3 in 1990 logbook

*begin
*flags surface
02    01      3.09   249    -08.5
02    03      4.13   252.5  -26
*end

04    03      6.00   020    +37
04    05      3.07   329    -31
06    05      2.67   203    -40.5
06    07      2.20   014    +04
07    08      2.98   032    +04
08    09      2.73   063.5  +21
09    10     12.35   059    +15

*begin
*flags surface
11    10      4.20   221.5  -11.5
11    12      5.05   215    +03.5
11    13      6.14   205    +12.5
13    14     15.40   221    -14
*end

*end BtoC</programlisting>

<Para>
Note that to avoid needless complication, Survex regards each leg as
being either "surface" or "not surface" - if a leg spans the boundary you'll
have to call it one or the other.  It's good surveying practice to
deliberately put a station at the surface/underground interface
(typically the highest closed contour or drip line) so this generally
isn't an onerous restriction.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Specify the ordering and type of data</Title>

<Para>The *DATA command is used to specify the data style, and the
order in which the readings are given.</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Deal with Plumbs or Legs Across Static Water</Title>

<!-- FIXME
<Para>
They can be given
as +90, or -90, but as they are not usually measured with the
clino, but with a plumb of some sort, then it is useful to distinguish
them in this way so that any clino adjustment is not applied to
these values.
</Para>

FIXME: paste in section from mail to list

<Para>
Note that a similar effect can be achieved by using the "*infer plumbs" command
to stop clino corrections being applied to -90 and +90 clino readings.
</Para>
-->

<Para>
Plumbed legs should be given using 'UP' or 'DOWN' in place of the
clino reading and a dash (or a different specified 'OMIT' character)
in place of the compass reading.  This distinguishes
them from legs measured with a compass and clino.  Here's an example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
1 2 21.54 - UP
3 2 7.36 017 +17
3 4 1.62 091 +08
5 4 10.38 - DOWN</programlisting>

<Para>
U/D or +V/-V may be used instead of UP/DOWN; the check is not case
sensitive.
</Para>

<Para>
Legs surveyed across the surface of a static body of water where no
clino reading is taken (since the surface of the water can be assumed
to be flat) can be indicated by using LEVEL in place of a clino reading.
This prevents the clino correction being applied.  Here's an example:
</Para>

<programlisting>
1 2 11.37 190 -12
3 2  7.36 017 LEVEL
3 4  1.62 091 LEVEL</programlisting>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Specify a BCRA grade</Title>

<Para>The *SD command can be used to specify the standard deviations of the
various measurements (tape, compass, clino, etc).  Examples files are
supplied which define BCRA Grade 3 and BCRA Grade 5 using a number of *sd
commands. You can use these by simply including them at the relevant point,
as follows:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin somewhere
; This survey is only grade 3
*include grade3
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
; etc
*end somewhere</programlisting>

<Para>The default values for the standard deviations are those for
BCRA grade 5. Note that it is good practice to keep the *include
Grade3 within *Begin and *End commands otherwise it will apply
to following survey data, which may not be what you intended.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Specify different accuracy for a leg</Title>

<Para>For example, suppose the tape on the plumbed leg in this survey
is suspected of being less accurate than the rest of the survey because
the length was obtained by measuring the length of the rope used to rig
the pitch.  We can set a higher sd for this one measurement and use a
*begin/*end block to make sure this setting only applies to the one
leg:
</Para>

<programlisting>
2 1 26.60 222  17.5
2 3 10.85 014   7
2 4  7.89 254 -11
*begin
; tape measurement was taken from the rope length
*sd tape 0.5 metres
4 5  34.50 - DOWN
*end
5 6  9.29 271 -28.5</programlisting>

<!-- FIXME also *calibrate and *instrument? Except rope is measure with the
tape... -->
</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Radiolocation Data</Title>

<!-- FIXME comments from David Gibson here -->
<Para>This is done by using the *SD command to specify the appropriate
errors for the radiolocation `survey leg' so that the loop closure
algorithm knows how to distribute errors if it forms part of a loop.
</Para>

<Para>The best approach for a radiolocation where the underground station
is vertically below the surface station is to represent it as a
plumbed leg, giving suitable SDs for the length and plumb angle. The
horizontal positioning of this is generally quite accurate, but the
vertical positioning may be much less well known. E.g: we have a
radiolocation of about 50m depth +/- 20m and horizontal accuracy of
+/- 8m. Over 50m the +/-8m is equivalent to an angle of 9 degrees, so
that is the expected plumb error. 20m is the expected error in the
length. To get the equivalent SD we assume that 99.74% of readings will
be within 3 standard deviations of the error value. Thus we divide the
expected errors by 3 to get the SD we should specify:
</Para> <!-- 3 SD? or same as BCRA3.SVX, etc -->

<programlisting>
*begin
*sd length 6.67 metres
*sd plumb 3 degrees
surface underground 50 - down
*end</programlisting>

<Para>
We wrap the radiolocation leg in a *begin/*end block to make
sure that the special *sd settings only apply to this one leg.
</Para>

<Para>For more information on the expected errors from radiolocations
see Compass Points Issue 10, available online at

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Diving Data</Title>

<Para>Surveys made underwater using a diver's depth gauge can be
processed - use the *Data command to specify that the following data
is of this type.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Enter Theodolite data</Title>

<Para>
Theodolite data with turned angles is not yet explicitly catered
for, so for now you will need to convert it into equivalent legs in
another style - normal or cylpolar are likely to be the best choices.
</Para>

<Para>
If there is no vertical info in your theodolite data then you should
use the cylpolar style and use *sd command to specify very low
accuracy (high SD) in the depth so that the points will move in the
vertical plane as required if the end points are fixed or the survey
is part of a loop.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect1><Title>General: How do I?</Title>

<Sect2><Title>Create a new survey</Title>

<Para>You simply create a text file containing the relevant survey data,
using a text editor, and save it with a suitable name with a &svx;
extension. The
easiest way is to look at some of the example data and use that
as a template. Nearly all surveys will need a bit of basic info
as well as the survey data itself: e.g. the date (*date), comments
about where, what cave, a name for the survey (using *begin and *end),
instrument error corrections etc. Here is a typical survey file:
</Para>

<Para>All the lines starting with ';' are comments, which are ignored
by &survexsuite;. You can also see the use of 'DOWN' for plumbs, and
*calibrate tape for dealing with a tape length error (in this case
the end of the tape had fallen off so measurements were made from the
20cm point).</Para>

<Sect2><Title>Join surveys together</Title>

<Para>Once you have more than one survey you need to specify how they
link together. To do this use *export to make the stations to be
joined accessible in the enclosing survey, then *equate in the
enclosing survey to join them together.
<!-- FIXME example -->
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Organise my surveys</Title>

<Para>This is actually a large subject. There are many ways you can
organise your data using &survexsuite;. Take a look at the example dataset
for some ideas of ways to go about it.
</Para>

<Sect3><Title>Fixed Points (Control Points)</Title>

<Para>The *fix command is used to specify fixed points (also know as control
points).  See the description of this command in the "Cavern Commands"
section of this manual.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3><Title>More than one survey per trip</Title>

<Para>Suppose you have two separate bits of surveying which were done on the
same trip.  So the calibration details, etc. are the same for both.  But you
want to give a different survey name to the two sections.  This is easily
achieved like so:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*begin
*calibrate compass 1.0
*calibrate clino 0.5
*begin altroute
; first survey
*end altroute
*begin faraway
; second survey
*end faraway
*end</programlisting>

</Sect3>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Add surface topology</Title>

<!-- FIXME put DEM support in aven -->
<Para>We intend to allow import of terrain data in DEM format, and also any
other formats in common use.  But at present the simplest approach is to
generate a &svx; file with the surface mesh in and display it with the
survey data.
</Para>

<Para>
It is possible to generate
a mesh or contours overlaying your area by various means.  In the USA,
usable resolution data can be obtained for free.  In other countries,
it's harder to come by.  Reading heights from the
contours on a map is one approach.  It's laborious, but feasible for
a small area.
</Para>

<Para>
Details of several methods are given in the BCRA Cave Surveying
Group magazine Compass Points issue 11, available online at
<ulink url="http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP11/CPoint11.htm#Art_5">http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP11/CPoint11.htm#Art_5</ulink>
</Para>

<Para>If you're using another program to generate a &svx; file for the surface
mesh, it's best to use the NOSURVEY data style.
Simply fix all the grid intersections at the correct
coordinates and height, and put legs between them using the NOSURVEY style.
Here's a grid of 4 squares and 9 intersections:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*fix 00 000 000 1070
*fix 01 000 100 1089
*fix 02 000 200 1093

*fix 10 100 000 1062
*fix 11 100 100 1080
*fix 12 100 200 1089

*fix 20 200 000 1050

<Para>
This is far simpler than trying to create fake tape/compass/clino legs of
the right length for each line in the mesh.  It's also very fast to process
with cavern.
</Para>

<Para>SpeleoGen can also help with this process if you want
final output in DXF form.  See the 'Related Tools' section of the
Survex website for download links.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Overlay a grid</Title>

<Para>Aven is able to display a grid, but this functionality isn't currently
available in caverot,
xcaverot,
or the printer drivers.
You can achieve a similar effect for now by creating a &svx; file
where the survey legs form a grid.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2><Title>Import data from other programs</Title>

<Para>&survexsuite; supports a number of features to help with importing
existing data. You can specify the ordering of items on a line using *Data
(see &survexsuite; Keywords above), and you can specify the characters used
to mean different things using *Set (see &survexsuite; Keywords above).
</Para>

<Para>The Ignore and Ignoreall options to the *Data command are often
particularly useful, e.g. if you have a dataset with LRUD info or comments
on the ends of lines.
</Para>

<Sect3><Title>Changing Meanings of Characters</Title>

<Para>e.g. if you have some data with station names containing the 
characters '?' and '+' (which are not permitted in a name by default)
then the command:
</Para>

<programlisting>
*SET NAMES ?+</programlisting>

<Para>
specifies that question marks and plus signs are permitted in station names.
A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 are always permitted. '_' and '-' are also permitted by
default, but aren't in this example.
</Para>

<Para>If your data uses a comma ',' instead of a decimal point, then
you use
</Para>

<programlisting>
*SET BLANK x09x20
*SET DECIMAL ,</programlisting>

<Para>to specify that ',' is no longer a blank character, and is now
the decimal separator instead of '.'.
</Para>

<!-- FIXME
<Para>Note that there are plenty of ways you can use this facility to
completely confuse the software, as it may not be able to work out what is
going on, or it may simply be ambiguous. It can cope with some ambiguity (e.g.
the '-' character is used both for 'MINUS' and for 'OMIT'), but there are
limits. If you have a dataset that you can not make &survexsuite;
understand, then send it to us, and we will see what can be done.

scroll off the screen and it's not always possible to scroll back to
read them.

One point to note (this tripped us up!): station names in DAT files are
case sensitive and so Survex reads DAT files with the equivalent of
