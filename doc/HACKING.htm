<H1>Hacking Survex</H1>

<p>(That's hacking in the "tinkering with code" sense, not in the
"breaking into other people's computer systems" sense).

<p>This is currently a random collection of notes that need to be written
down while I remember.  With time it should evolve into a more
coherent document.  If you have any questions which this should answer
but doesn't then ask me and I'll add them.

<H2>Network code debugging</H2>

<P>You can pick which network simplifications are attempted using "-z"
with an argument listing code letters.  So:

<ul>
<li>-z=    no special simplifications (articulation still performed)
<li>-z=l   remove "lollipops"
<li>-z=p   remove parallel legs
<li>-z=d   convert deltas to stars
</ul>

<P>And you can combine these in any combination:

<ul>
<li>-z=lp  remove "lollipops" and parallel legs
<li>-z=lpd remove "lollipops" and parallel legs; convert deltas to stars
</ul>

<P>"-z=lpd" is the default (in 0.99 at least - more transformations may
conceivably be added in future, although the simple common cases are
already covered).

<H2>Developing on Unix Platforms</H2>

<P>You'll need automake 1.5 or later (earlier versions don't support
per-executable CFLAGS; 1.6 has been tested and works, but wasn't a
very stable release - automake 1.6.1 is a better bet)
and autoconf 2.50 or later (autoconf 2.52, 2.53 and 2.64 have all
been used successfully).

<P>For building the documentation you'll need sgmltools 2 or later,
jadetex, docbook-to-man, and w3m.

<P>On debian squeeze: sudo apt-get install sgmltools-lite jadetex docbook-to-man w3m

<H2>Building on Non-Unix Platforms</H2>

<H3>Mingw (Microsoft Windows)</H3>

<P>Currently I build this with a Linux hosted cross-compiler.  I use
the packaged cross-compiler in the debian testing/unstable distribution:

<code>
sudo apt-get install mingw32
</code>
<!-- g++-mingw-w64 -->

<P>Building on Windows in a native mingw environment will probably
require tinkering.  Best bet is probably to install bash and use the
current configure script.  I'm happy to help if you want to try this,
and I'll incorporate patches provided they're fairly clean.

<H2>Microsoft Windows Installer Builder</H2>

<P>We use <A HREF="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</A> to
build the MS Windows Installer.  Survex 1.2.8 was built using InnoSetup
5.5.3 (non-Unicode version, so that the installer works on older versions
of Microsoft Windows).

<P>Here are some random notes:

<H3>Packages Needed</H3>

<P>On Debian, the commands to install wine vary depending on the architecture
you're running - to check this use:

<pre>
dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_GNU_CPU
</pre>

<H4>For i386</H4>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install wine wx2.8-i18n
</pre>

<H4>For x86_64</H4>

<P>You'll need to enable multi-arch and install the i386 packages of wine:

<pre>
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wine wine-bin:i386 wx2.8-i18n
</pre>

<H4>Common</H4>

<P>And then run:

<pre>
wine ~/Downloads/isetup-5.5.3.exe
</pre>

<H3>Translations</H3>

<P>In addition to the translations included with InnoSetup as standard, we also
add these, which you can find in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of Xapian's
source tree:

<UL>
<li>ChineseSimplified.isl (Unofficial translation; for 5.5.3+)
<li>ChineseTraditional.isl (Candidate official translation; for 5.5.0+)
<li>EnglishGB.isl (Unofficial translation, done by Olly; for 5.5.3+)
<li>Indonesian.isl (Unofficial translation; for 5.5.3+)
<li>Romanian.isl (Unofficial translation; for 5.5.3+)
<li>Slovak.isl (Unofficial translation; for 5.5.3+)
</UL>

<H3>survex.iss</H3>

<P>This file is generated by configure (from the template survex.iss.in).
We could instead have a static survex.iss which uses #include to pull in
a file with the Survex version info in, but the current method works well
enough so we'll stick with it for now (I suspect #include was introduced since
we started using InnoSetup).
