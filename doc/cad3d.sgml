<para>
Cad3d can currently output DXF, Skencil, or SVG files for import into CAD
packages.  It can also produce Compass .plt files, which are primarily intended
for importing into Carto, but can also be used with Compass itself.
</para>

<Para>An alternative to cad3d is SpeleoGen, which can be found in the
<ulink url="http://survex.com/related.html">"Related Tools" section of the
Survex web site.</ulink>
SpeleoGen is a Windows (3.1/95/NT) utility which reads in
&survexsuite; &x3d; files, LRUD passage wall data (in <filename>.cav</filename> format)
and surface topography info in <filename>.csv</filename> format.  The results are
combined, displayed, and saved out as a DXF file for import into
CAD or drawing packages.
