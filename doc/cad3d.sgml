<para>
Cad3d can currently output DXF or Sketch files for import into CAD packages.
It can also produce a crude cut-down version of a Compass .plt file, which
is suitable for importing into Carto (and little else).
</para>

<Para>An alternative to cad3d is SpeleoGen, which can be found in the
"Related Tools" section of the Survex web site. <!--FIXME: url-->
SpeleoGen is a Windows (3.1/95/NT) utility which reads in
&survexsuite; &x3d; files, LRUD passage wall data (in <filename/.cav/ format)
and surface topography info in <filename/.csv/ format.  The results are
combined, displayed, and saved out as a DXF file for import into
CAD or drawing packages.
</Para>
