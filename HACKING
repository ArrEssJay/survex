Hacking Survex
==============

(That's hacking in the "tinkering with code" sense, not in the
"breaking into other people's computer systems" sense).

This is currently a random collection of notes that need to be written
down while I remember.  With time it should evolve into a more
coherent document.  If you have any questions which this should answer
but doesn't then ask me and I'll add them.

Network code debugging
======================

You can pick which network simplifications are attempted using "-z"
with an argument listing code letters.  So:

-z=    no special simplifications (articulation still performed)
-z=l   remove "lollipops"
-z=p   remove parallel legs
-z=d   convert deltas to stars

And you can combine these in any combination:

-z=lp  remove "lollipops" and parallel legs
-z=lpd remove "lollipops" and parallel legs; convert deltas to stars

"-z=lpd" is the default (in 0.92 at least - more transformations may
conceivably be added in future, although the simple common cases are
already covered).

Building on Non-Unix Platforms
==============================

DJGPP (MSDOS for 386 or better)
-------------------------------

Currently I build this with a Linux hosted cross-compiler.  I built
this myself mostly following instructions from:

http://www.objsw.com/CrossGCC/

I suggest using binutils-2.10 rather than binutils-2.9.1.  The newer version
includes the patch they supply, so the instructions boil down to this
sequence of commands:

bash
mkdir ~/djcross
cd ~/djcross
wget ftp://ftp.objsw.com/pub/crossgcc/build-djgpp.sh
mkdir tars
cd tars
wget ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/old/djcrx202.zip
wget http://sunsite.org.uk/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz
wget http://sunsite.org.uk/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.10.tar.gz
cd ..
patch -l build-djgpp.sh <<END
26c26
< binutils=binutils-2.9.1
---
> binutils=binutils-2.10
97c97
<       patch -p1 <\$patches/\$binutilsdiff
---
>       #patch -p1 <\$patches/\$binutilsdiff
END
sh build-djgpp.sh

Building under DOS in a native djgpp environment will probably require
tinkering.  Best bet is either to install bash and use the current
configure script, or perhaps simpler to modify miniam.pl to generate a
suitable makefile.  I'm happy to help if you want to try this, and
I'll incorporate patches provided they're fairly clean.

Mingw (MS Windows)
------------------

Currently I build this with a Linux hosted cross-compiler.  I use
pre-built binaries for gcc 2.95.2 obtained from:

http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

Building on Windows in a native mingw environment will probably
require tinkering.  Best bet is probably to install bash and use the
current configure script.  I'm happy to help if you want to try this,
and I'll incorporate patches provided they're fairly clean.

Building on Windows with MSVC/BorlandC/Watcom/... is likely to be more
work, but could be a worthwhile project.  I'd suggest patching the
perl script miniam.pl to generate a suitable makefile.  Again, send
patches if you get this to work.

MSDOS for 286 and earlier (BorlandC)
------------------------------------

Wookey currently builds this with a rather elderly BorlandC++ 3.1.
BorlandC++ 5.5 can be downloaded for free, but it appears to only compile to
32 bit code.  You can also download TurboC version 2, which might do the job
(I've not tried yet).

You can build a suitable source archive for this version using
`make alien_src_zip' on the source distribution on a Unix box (you need to
have run `./configure' first).

RISC OS
-------

We now build this with Acorn C V5.  It will probably still build with
Acorn C V4.  You also need to get and install OSLib from:

http://www.arcade.demon.co.uk/oslib/homepage.html

You can build a suitable source archive for compiling the RISC OS version by
running `make alien_src_zip' on the source distribution on a Unix box (you
need to have run `./configure' first).  However for this you'll need a
specially tweaked version of zip to create the zip file with the correct
RISC OS file types. I can supply this on request.  You need to put it in the
top level of the source tree and call it `zip-magic'.

You'll probably need to use Acorn's Make Utility (`amu') to build - the GNU
make 1.02 port doesn't seem up to the job.
