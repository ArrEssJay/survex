Changes in 1.2.0 (2011-09-18):

* Translation updates for Catalan, French, Romanian, Spanish, Slovak, and US
  English.

* tests/smoke.tst: aven no longer requires an X display for --help or
  --version, so replace skip of this check with a check that this remains the
  case.

* We now use the standard .po and .pot file formats for storing translations
  (rather than the Survex-specific messages.txt format), and then translate
  these into Survex's .msg format.

* (Unix version): Move survex man page to section 7 (since it isn't documenting
  an actual command).

* (Unix version): Write each generated man page to a temporary file, then
  atomically rename, to avoid leaving an empty or partial man page behind if
  docbook-to-man dies (1.1.16 had an empty cad3d.1, and we want to avoid a
  recurrence of that).

* (Unix version): Default to installing docs into /usr/share/doc/survex rather
  than /usr/doc/survex.

* aven:

  + Aven icon redrawn in SVG format - it's now a vector image which looks
    nicer at larger sizes.

  + Explicitly request double-buffering, which seems to be needed for systems
    with GLX >= 1.3.

  + Fix crash while trying to load certain .3d files.

  + Movie export code updated to work with more recent versions of FFmpeg.
    Currently this is disabled in Microsoft Windows builds, pending getting the
    required libraries set up for building releases.

  + Reporting of errors during movie export improved.

  + Force playback speed to "x1" during movie export.

  + Use stock IDs for buttons where appropriate - such buttons may now be
    rendered with icons on some platforms.

  + If a label isn't valid UTF-8, treat it as CP1252 (the Microsoft superset of
    ISO8859-1).

  + (Unix version): Remove special handling for toggling "full screen" on wxGTK
    as it's no longer required with modern versions.

  + Don't redraw the survey on every mouse movement in the survey pane unless
    the measuring line is (or just was) active.  (ticket #17)

* cavern:

  + Drop "non-fatal" from the report of how many errors there were at the end
    of the run - it just confuses users - we won't even get here if there's a
    fatal error!

  + Add --3d-version option to allow the user to specify the version of the 3d
    format to output.  (ticket#21)

* img library:

  + Make the highest and lowest valid values for img_output_version available
    in img.h as IMG_VERSION_MIN and IMG_VERSION_MAX.

* (Mac OS X version): Fix buildmacosx.sh script to check where the temporary
  volume actually gets mounted.  Build for x86_64 as well as i386.  Fix URL
  for downloading wxWidgets, and use wxWidgets 2.8.12 by default.

Changes in 1.1.16 (2011-05-16):

* Translation updates for German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian
  Portuguese, and US English.

* Use horizontal ellipses character rather than '...' and right arrow character
  rather than '->' where these characters are available.

* (Unix version): Link with -lGL, if it exists, to support linking with gold or
  GNU ld --as-needed (Debian bug #615781).

* img.c:

  + Fix code typo for IMG_API_VERSION == 0 case.

  + Fix code typo in code used when IMG_HOSTED isn't defined.

* doc/TODO.htm: Remove entries which have now been done.

* (Microsoft Windows version): aven: We now include all the available
  translations for messages from wxWidgets, which means that standard widgets
  will appear translated where available even if Survex messages aren't
  translated.

Changes in 1.1.15 (2010-10-15):

* aven:

  + In the cavern log window, change the "Rerun" button to "Reprocess" to
    follow terminology in manual and elsewhere.  Fixes ticket#15.

  + When displaying output from cavern, don't update the window after every
    line, but only when we don't have data from cavern pending.  Hopefully
    addresses ticket#12.

  + If we aren't using GL_POINTS for blobs, draw them using a series of
    abutting lines rather than with gluDisk which is faster and gives a
    consistent shape.

  + Check whether blobs and crosses actually render correctly as points/point
    sprites, and if they don't, fall back to drawing them with lines.  The
    best method is cached on disk, and rechecked automatically if the graphics
    hardware is changed or the drivers upgraded.

  + Fix non-USE_FNT case to work again (it's limited to ISO-8859-1 characters
    though, so we still enable USE_FNT by default).

  + Don't offer "All files" wildcard in presentation save dialog.

  + (Microsoft Windows): Handle filenames with non-Latin1 characters in in
    more places.

  + (Microsoft Windows): Quote filenames with spaces and metacharacters in
    when running cavern from aven.  Fixes ticket#11.

* editwrap: (Microsoft Windows): Handle filenames with non-Latin1 characters.

* diffpos: Handle files with duplicate labels in better - extend generates
  duplicate labels when it breaks a loop.

* Enable eswap-break testcase now that diffpos handles duplicate station names.

* New v7 of .3d format which stores survey dates as number of days since
  January 1st 1900, so we now support dates from 1900-2078 (rather than
  1970-2037) with a smaller file size.  The img API is now versioned - you
  can select the new "version 1" by compiling with -DIMG_API_VERSION=1, which
  gives the survey dates in days in days1 and days2 instead of as time_t
  values in date1 and date2.  Fixes ticket#14.

* Consistently use http://survex.com/ rather than http://www.survex.com/ - the
  former has been the canonical name for some time, with www.survex.com just
  redirecting to it.

* (Unix version): Use unlocked file I/O if available, which can be much faster
  in some cases (we don't need the locking as we don't do multithreaded file
  I/O).

* (Mac version): Fix compilation failure due to clash with Point in Mac OS X
  headers.

* (Mac version): buildmacosx.sh now works again.

* Most tests weren't actually running any testcases (looks like a sh
  portability issue).  This is now fixed, and fortunately all tests still pass.

* Include the extra .isl translation files for Innosetup in the source archive.

Changes in 1.1.14 (2010-07-26):

* Restore compatibility with wxWidgets 2.6 (1.1.13 required wxWidgets 2.8).

* aven:

  + After processing survey data, if there were warnings or errors, add a
    "Rerun" button to allow easy reprocessing after fixing problems.  If there
    were only warnings, also add an "OK" button to allow moving on to viewing
    the processed survey data (fixes ticket#13).

  + Optimise updating of the cavern log window (hopefully fixes ticket#12).

  + Fix links in cavern log window to link from exactly '<file>:<line>' (and
    not the ': ' after), and to make the title for the terminal the
    warning/error message.  Avoid false positives by checking that '<line>' is
    a number.

  + Don't double escape the contents of href and target in links in the cavern
    log window.

  + Improve handling of the splitter window, fixing behavioural glitches in
    various cases.

  + Highlight stations matching any current search when a file is loaded.
    (ticket#9)

  + (Mac version): Fix build issue due to Mac OS X polluting the global
    namespace with its own "Point" class.

  + (Unix version): The Gnome print dialog has its own preview window so
    suppress ours if using the Gnome one.

  + (Unix version): Link aven with -lGLU which SuSE Linux needs.

  + (Microsoft Windows version): Fix handling of a double-click on the survey
    tree when built with wxWidgets >= 2.8.11.

* cavern: Report relevant file and line number for three warnings which didn't
  give them before.

* (Unix and Mac versions): configure: Update the wx-config probing code -
  wxmac-config etc aren't present with newer wxWidgets versions so there's no
  point looking for them now.

* (Mac version): buildmacosx.sh: This script builds a diskimage with Survex in
  for easy installation.  Update it to work with the latest Survex versions
  (use WX_CONFIG not WXCONFIG; use a Unicode build of wxWidgets; if building a
  private wxWidgets, use 2.8.11 not 2.7.0-1).

* manual:

  + Correctly capitalise "GTK".

  + Note that on Linux we only regularly test builds with the GTK+ version
    (change taken from 1.0).

* Fixed the cad3d man page, which was an empty file in 1.1.13.

Changes in 1.1.13 (2010-06-16):

* Say "wxWidgets" instead of "wxWindows" consistently.

* img.c: Fix small memory leak (filename_opened member).

* cad3d, aven: Fix export to SVG when a label contains a '%' character.

* aven:

  + wxWidgets 2.6.0 or newer is now required.

  + A "Unicode" build of wxWidgets is now supported.  An "ANSI" build may still
    work but hasn't been tested recently (all packaged versions of wxWidgets
    seem to be Unicode now).

  + Fix potential uses of uninitialised variables which may have been causing
    occasional glitches when loading a file on start-up.

  + Improvements to the handling of the font used for plotting labels and other
    text on the survey pane:

    - Loading the font file is more efficient.

    - Character spacing is improved.

    - Default font is now anti-aliased.

  + "About" dialog:

    - Add "Copy" button to copy the system info to the clipboard for easier
      bug reporting.

    - List OpenGL extensions last, since there are usually lots of them with a
      modern gfx card.

    - Fix 100% CPU usage while the "About" dialog is open.

  + Processing .svx files:

    - Passing a .svx file on the command line now works better.

    - Put the survey data log window in a splitter in the usual frame rather
      than opening a separate frame for it.

    - Auto-scroll the log window until we've reported a warning or error.

    - Fix small memory leak.

  + The presentation filename now defaults to using the basename of the
    currently loaded dataset, but we always prompt before we first save with
    such a name.

  + Reduce memory usage when saving a screenshot.

  + Allow "Toggle Fullscreen" to work even if no survey is loaded now that we
    persist the window size (and maximised or fullscreen state) between
    invocations.

  + Fix reporting of OpenGL errors.

  + Fix glitches when tilting while looking East.

  + Added Portuguese and Slovak translations of wxWidgets messages.

* Documentation:

  + Rationalise manual formats - replace PostScript with PDF and drop RTF.

  + Drop the "alternative manual formats" self-extracting zip file - people
    will generally just want one of the formats, so downloading several
    together isn't very useful.

  + 3dformat.htm: Update for v6 format (thanks to Mike McCombe).

  + GPL.htm: Replace HTML version of licence with a link to the version on
    the FSF website.

  + ChngeLog.htm: Stop generating an HTML version of the ChangeLog - it's too
    low level to be of interest to non-developers, and developers can look at
    the source code.

* (Unix version): configure: New preferred name for specifying wx-config script
  is WX_CONFIG.  WXCONFIG still supported for compatibility.

* (Linux version): Source RPM package dropped as you can just build an RPM
  package from the source tarball.

* (Microsoft Windows version): The installer is now created with a newer
  version of InnoSetup, which gives a 10% smaller download.

Changes in 1.1.12 (2007-02-07):

* aven:

  + Remember the window size or maximised/fullscreen state between invocations.

  + Add options dialog to "Export" similar to the one for "Print".

  + The "number of pages required" in the print dialog now updates when you
    change what is to be shown (underground legs/surface legs/station
    names/crosses).

Changes in 1.1.11 (2006-11-25):

* Updated Czech, Spanish, and Slovak translations.

* (MacOS X version): Assorted OS X specific tweaks and fixes.

* aven:

  + Pick a smaller and clearer font for labels.

  + Fix character spacing.

  + Tweak display of bearing and elevation angles to look nicer with
    proportional fonts.

  + Use the title from the 3d (or plt, etc) file for the window title
    rather than the filename.

  + Show distances to 2 decimal places rather than the nearest integer.

  + Only consider underground legs when calculating the depth bands and
    depth colouring.

  + Add "Colour by Error".

  + Add entry for "white" in date and error keys.

  + When setting the view to a single point, don't change the scale.

  + If reloading the same file, don't change the view

  + Fix filetypes selector in open dialog.

  + Fix the charset we use for aven in certain cases.

  + Call msg_init before using msg_lang or it won't ever be set!

  + Pass wx the full language code to initialise the C library locale.

  + Fix bug in generating prefix tree view which could lead to a bogus
    leading dot on some survey names (bug probably introduced in 1.1.10).

  + "New Presentation" now ensures that the side panel is open

  + Fix updating of cached opengl lists when the view is reset to the
    default.

* Ignore LANG if it starts with a digit to avoid problems with bogus value for
  LANG which AutoCAD installation seems to set on MS Windows.

* (Unix version): configure: Allow SGMLTOOLS and DOCBOOK_TO_MAN to be
  specified.  Either/both can be set to ":".

* dump3d: Report unknown (to dump3d) codes returned by img.

* img library: Flag all stations as underground in the old "ASCII" .3d format.

Changes in 1.1.10 (2006-07-14):

* aven: Clicking on a survey name in the survey tree now highlights it in
  the map view.  Double-clicking zooms the view to show the clicked survey
  highlighted.  Clicking the root clears the highlighting and double-clicking
  the root restores the default view.  To expand/collapse a branch, click
  on the "[+]" or "[-]" icon to the left of the survey name.

* aven: The measuring line can now measure to anywhere in plan or elevation
  view (not just to a station!)  In plan view the horizontal distance and
  bearing are shown, while in elevation view the vertical distance is shown.

* aven: Moving the mouse over a station in the survey view now highlights
  that station in the survey tree (though it may not be visible if the
  survey(s) it is in aren't expanded).

* aven: Clicking on a station to centre the view now moves the mouse pointer
  to the new location of the station (except on Mac OS X where this isn't
  allowed).

* aven: Fix which presentation toolbar buttons are shown as depressed.

* Fix infinite loop reading 3d files with LRUD data (bug introduced in 1.1.9).

* vim files are now installed with the correct paths (bug introduced in 1.1.9).

Changes in 1.1.9 (2006-07-04):

* (Unix version): Install desktop files for aven and svxedit contributed to the
  Ubuntu package by Phil Bull, and corresponding pixmaps.

* Fix img to filter out cross-sections which don't match the subsurvey (if
  specified).  The API now returns img_XSECT_END to mark the end of a
  passage rather than setting a flag on the last img_XSECT of the passage.

* Enhance integration with the vim editor - this can now colour .err files, run
  cavern from vim and parse error output, and run aven from vim.  Tweak the
  existing vim mode for .svx files to fix a few minor bugs and add support for
  the new "*data passage" style.

* aven: fix drawing of the "blob" end of the measuring line on graphics cards
  which can't draw large enough blobs for us.

* aven: sort out confusion about what encoding everything is in which means
  that the distance measured by the measuring line actually gets displayed
  and also fixes problems with empty menu items in non-English locales in
  some cases.

* aven: redraw grey background after a menu is closed over the aven window
  with no survey loaded.

* aven: fix bug which caused printing to crash (introduced in 1.1.8).

* aven: avoid crash on some machines when opening "About" dialog before having
  loaded a survey.

* aven: Translate "Plan" and "Elevation" buttons in print view dialog.

* (Unix version): aven: Fix character set handling of cavern output.

* cavern: Report an error if a cross-section is specified for a station which
  doesn't exist.

* Updated French and Italian translations.

* (Unix version): aven: Fix "Can't open message file `en_US' using path
  `${prefix}/share/survex'" error.

* Fix bug in 3d file reading on 64 bit platforms when used in STANDALONE mode
  (doesn't affect Survex itself, but other applications which use img.c should
  update their copy).

* (Unix version): Add checks that wxWidgets is a non-unicode version (wx 2.6
  and later are caught by configure, whereas older wx versions are caught when
  trying to compile).

Changes in 1.1.8 (2006.06.30):

* Drop support for building with wxWidgets versions prior to 2.4.0
  (which was released on 2003-01-07).

* aven: Printing through aven now uses settings from the "[aven]" section
  of print.ini, and support for hierarchical sections (using "like=")
  has been disabled.

* aven: Change mouse actions to be compatible with those in Survex 1.0.
  The mousewheel now zooms in/out (it doesn't do anything in 1.0) and
  left drag is now smart about not rotating and zooming at the same
  time.

* aven: Highlighting stations now happens as you type, and pressing
  "Enter" or clicking the "Find" button now pans and zooms to show the
  highlighted stations.

* aven: Left-clicking away from a station now cancels measuring line.

* aven: Setting view to North, South, East, or West is now animated like
  the tilt from plan to elevation.

* aven: Fix presentation saving to also write "." for decimal points and
  presentation loading to accept either "." or ",".

* (Unix version): aven: Add text for all toolbar items so that aven
  will work with the Gnome desktop preference for displaying toolbars as
  icons with text or just text (wxWidgets needs fixing first though).

* (Unix version): aven: Remove the ability to detach the menu bar (yell
  if you actually used it and I'll restore it!)

* aven: Add "all survey files" option to the "open file" dialog.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Fix cursor keys to pan survey.

* (MS Windows version): Built with wxWidgets 2.6.3 instead of 2.6.2.

* (MS Windows version): Fix installer to work on Windows 2000 or XP if
  run by an unprivileged user.

* (MS Windows version): Upgrade to the latest version of InnoSetup (the
  installer builder we use) and include new installer translations for
  UK English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, and Slovak.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Include Catalan and Brazilian Portuguese
  translations of messages for wxWidgets (the GUI library we use).

* aven: Disable "Highlight exported points" if there aren't any.

* Updates to French translation from Michel Bovey.  Also updates to German,
  Italian, Catalan, Spanish, and Romanian translations.

* (Unix version): test suite: fix smoke test to pass even without X running
  (it was meant to but the code had a bug).

* aven: Check if OpenGL is available and exit cleanly with a helpful error
  if it isn't.

* (Unix version): aven: Fix --help and --version to work without a working
  X display (provided it's built with wxWidgets 2.5.1 or newer).

* aven: Automatically select the presentation tab of the notebook when the user
  selects "New Presentation" or "Open Presentation".

* aven: Fix "Delete" in the presentation list to not get passed on (and so not
  reset to default view as well).

* aven: Fix Ctrl+Insert in the presentation list not to segfault if the list is
  empty.

* aven: Fix Cursor Up and Down in the presentation list to move the highlight
  up and down instead of being passed on and moving the survey.

* aven: Improve SVG output compatibility.  Tested with Mozilla Firefox 1.5,
  Adobe's SVG browser plugin, Gimp 2.2.8, Gqview 2.0.0, Opera 8.5,
  Safari 2.0.3, and InkScape 0.42.

* aven: Put a 5mm border around exported SVG files to allow for station markers
  and non-zero width lines.

* aven: Fix crash when exporting as SVG or Sketch if labels or surface data
  was turned on.

* aven: Actually close the file we're exporting which fixes problems with it
  not always being fully written.

Changes in 1.1.7 (2005.10.18):

* cavern: Add validity checking for dates in *date commands (with feature
  test in testsuite).  A date entered as just "year" or "year.month" now
  becomes a date range for the relevant period (previously it became a single
  date near the middle of that period).

* extend: Fixed 2 uninitialised flags (should fix erratic behaviour on
  with MS Windows).

* extend: Default output name for a file called input.3d is now input_extend.3d
  rather than just extend.3d (which was annoying if you wanted to extend
  several surveys in the same directory).

* aven: OpenGL 2.0 always includes support for point sprites so rework
  our check for them to include that knowledge.

* aven: Regenerate depth bar if user switches to/from metric units.

* aven: Don't clear the "there" mark just because the mouse pointer has
  moved off a station.

* aven: When processing a .svx file, put the resultant .3d file in the
  same directory (since that's where we then try to load it from).

* aven: Fix labelling of date colouring on 32 bit platforms.

* aven: If "colour by date" is on and we load a survey with no date info
  (or all surveyed on the same date) then set "colour by none".

* aven: Make the error dialog modal and remove a signal handler once it
  has fired to prevent endless (or seemingly endless) cascades of error
  dialogs.

* aven: Enforce a minimum object volume diameter of 1m to avoid problems
  if a survey file with only one station in is loaded.

* aven: Fix problems with indicators disappearing when we're drawing
  blobs and/or crosses the slow (but always supported) way.  (Problem
  introduced in 1.1.6).

* (Unix version): aven: Really stop setting extra toolbar margin when using
  GTK2.0.  The attempt to fix this in 1.1.3 failed because __WXGTK12__ is
  set for GTK+ 1.2 or *any later release* so is true for GTK+ 2.0 too!

* (Unix version): aven: Add details of which of wxGTK, wxMotif, and wxX11
  we've been compiled with, and which GTK+/Motif version where appropriate.

* (Unix version): Fixed build on Fedora Core 3.

* documentation: Updates to 3d file format specification from Mike McCombe.

Changes in 1.1.6 (2005.10.10):

* (MS Windows version): Distribution is about a third smaller than 1.1.5
  (mostly because mingwm10.dll is no longer required).

* aven: If aven is asked to load a .svx, .dat, or .mak file, run cavern on
  it, showing cavern's output in a window (with errors and warnings clickable
  to load the offending file into an editor), and then loading the resulting
  3d file.

* aven: Added "Colour by Date" option.

* aven: Disable "Colour by Depth" option if there's no elevation variation.

* aven: Don't crash if trying to load a survey with no elevation variation.
  Instead turn off depth colouring.

* aven: Export as HPGL added.

* aven: Improved update of mouse coordinates and measuring line (thanks to
  Martin Green).

* aven: Show the coordinates of either the mouse pointer or the nearest
  survey station to it (if there is one near enough).  Showing both was
  confusing and meant the status bar overflowed on smaller displays.

* aven: When printing an extended elevation, don't show bearing and elevation.

* aven: Don't lock "flat" surveys which aren't extended elevations - a
  flat survey with LRUD data isn't flat any more!

* aven: When we have to draw blobs and crosses the slow way (because the
  graphics hardware doesn't support the fast way), draw them so that they
  should appear at the correct depth into the 3D scene instead of on top
  of everything else.

* aven: Make "play presentation backwards" icon green to match the other
  presentation icons.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Mouse clicks on the survey view now set the
  keyboard focus there.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Fix first redraw of a newly loaded survey.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Fix redrawing of measuring line.

* cavern: Store dates for img_XSECT.

* cavern: Fixed small one-off memory leak if you specify -o more than once.

* (Unix version): Check environmental variable LC_MESSAGES when deciding what
  language to use for messages.

* (MS Windows version): "Print" on a 3d file now prints through aven rather
  than the separate printer driver (Unix has done this for some time).

* Removed old printer drivers.

* img library: When creating a 3d file, ignore img_XSECT if we've been asked
  to write a file format version which doesn't support it.

Changes in 1.1.5 (2005.09.20):

* (MS Windows version): aven: Fixed crash on start-up (introduced in 1.1.4).

* aven: Make blobs round like they are in Survex 1.0.

* aven: If the graphics drivers don't support drawing blobs using OpenGL
  point markers, fall back to drawing filled circles.

* aven: If the graphics drivers support it, draw crosses as texture mapped
  OpenGL point markers which is much faster.

* aven: Cross size increased to match Survex 1.0.

* aven: We must update which blobs are displayed if display of surface or
  underground legs is toggled.

* cavern: Fix handling of a *solve followed by survey data, none of which is
  attached to the previous data.

* cavern: Fixed "No survey data" error when a *solve is followed by another
  *solve (or the implicit solve at the end of processing) with no data between
  them.

Changes in 1.1.4 (2005.09.19):

* aven: Added Aven's icon to the "About" dialog.

* aven: Use localised character for the decimal point (e.g. "," in most
  continental European countries).

* aven: Previously the survey tree would get focus and then take keypresses
  (e.g. "P", "L", "Delete").  Now we pass most keypresses across so they
  operate on the cave, and transfer the input focus across when we do.

* aven: Make pressing "Return" in the tree control expand/collapse a subtree.

* aven: Speed up intialisation by delaying creation of OpenGL lists until
  they're needed.

* aven: Added Mark Shinwell's bounding box with shadow of the survey.

* aven: Disable the "Tubes" button/menu item when there's no LRUD data.

* aven: Reworded "Restore Default Settings" as "Restore Default View".

* (Unix version): aven: Set sensible default margins for printing and preserve
  any margin values the user specifies between runs (previously margins
  defaulted to 0 each time aven was run).

* Documentation: Document *DATA PASSAGE in the manual.

Changes in 1.1.3 (2005.09.07):

* (Microsoft Windows version): Fixed build problems.

* cavern: Allow OMIT character (-) for left/right/up/down.

* aven: Remove an unnecessary menu separator.

* aven: Fix "Find" and "Hide" toolbar buttons to work with GTK2.0.

* aven: Make the tooltip for "Hide" show the number of found stations.

* aven: If * or ? is used in a glob-style pattern, force a non-substring match.

* aven: Enable "New Presentation" when there's a 3d file loaded, rather than
  when there's a presentation loaded.

* aven: Make entrances green in side panel tree list to match green blobs used
  in cave view.

* aven: Don't show surface labels if we're not showing surface data, etc.

* aven: Merge "Start Rotation" and "Stop Rotation" into "Toggle Rotation" and
  make "Space" the key for this.  Keep Return working "Stop Rotation" so
  existing users are happy, but don't advertise it.

* aven: Normalise filename by adding any extension used, and use the normalised
  filename for file history and window title.

* (Unix version): aven: Stop setting extra toolbar margin when using GTK2.0
  as the toolbar buttons already have a sensible margin - the extra margin is
  only needed with GTK1.2.

* aven: Fix handling of plumb legs in tube model.

* aven: Fixed swapped L and R in tube model.

* extend: Preserve UD cross-section information in extended elevation.

* extend: Add new messages for John Pybus' enhancements.

Changes in 1.1.2 (never formally released):

* Added support for LRUD data in .svx files, in .3d files, and aven can
  now load and display it on screen and on printouts.  The ability to "fake"
  LRUD data in aven is gone for now but will reappear in some form later.

* cavern: Removed support for writing Chasm's 3dx format.  We're going to
  fold any desirable missing chasm functionality into aven.

* aven: Rearranged mouse actions as discussed on the mailing list.  Added
  cursors for each different mouse action to help the user learn what each
  does.  Also added cursors for the "compass" and "clino" as well as the
  scalebar to suggest to the user that they can be dragged to change the view.

* (Unix version): aven: Don't segfault if LANG isn't a known language.

* tests/smoketest.tst: If X windows is running, check that we can run aven
  with --help and --version.

* tests/cavern.tst: Fixed cavern.tst to warn if it is skipping a test because
  no results are listed for it.  This revealed that there was a "newline" test
  which should have been called "badnewline", and was a broken testcase too!
  Fixed all these problems.

* cavern: Applied Simeon Warner's patch for handling backcompass, backclino,
  and omitted forward compass/clino readings in Compass DAT files.  Added
  a feature test for this to the testsuite.

* It no longer makes sense to have an option not to build aven or to build aven
  without OpenGL so remove old machinery for this from configure and the
  sources.

* (Unix version): configure: Check if "-lXxf86vm" is needed.

* configure: Better output for strcasecmp test.

* aven: Fix crosses to work much better.  Not a total fix - their position
  in the Z buffer isn't correct and they're rather slow to plot.

* aven: Don't regenerate the hittest grid every time the mouse moves while
  animating, which solves the mysterious pausing effect (thanks go to Martin
  Green for spotting this!)  Also clear all the status bar coordinates when
  animating.

* aven: Sort out clashing menu shortcuts in some languages.

* aven: Fixed compilation problem on x86_64

* SPUD: Pruned out stuff which has been done or which is not actually relevant
  to this branch.

* Merge various changes from 1.0 branch:

  + aven: Port over "printing from aven" functionality.

  + aven: Port over "export as" functionality,

  + Add David Loeffler's vim mode for .svx files.

* aven: Fix check for whether a label is behind us in perspective view.

* aven: Don't use an opengl list for drawing the indicators - we typically make
  a new list each time we plot them anyway.

* Remove lingering traces of support for RISC OS and pre-386 MSDOS

* aven: Set icon on non-Windows platforms too.  This means that with
  WindowMaker on Unix you get an icon on the AppIcon by default.

* configure: Update wxWindows checks to handle newer wx versions.

* Make all maintainer perl scripts "use bytes;" to avoid utf-8 double encoding
  problems.  They also all require Perl 5.8 now (hopefully this isn't an issue
  for anyone building from CVS).

* acinclude.m4: Quote macro name for fix autotools warning.

* Documentation: "tilt up" is "'" not ",".

* aven: Add support for mousewheels (to tilt the cave).

* aven: Fixed twisted transitions to and from pitches in certain cases.

* aven: Pick a sensible initial window size when the user's desktop is spread
  over more than one monitor (works best with wx2.5 or newer, but try to do
  better with wx2.4 or earlier as well).

* aven: Initialise GfxCore slightly later to avoid visual glitch from notebook
  contents being visible before any survey is loaded.

* aven: Allow a coloured texture to be used

* aven: Don't initialise until we have data (to the user, this means the window
  is default colour (grey for most systems) not black until a survey is
  loaded).

* aven: Fixed weird "shadowed" icons.

Changes in 1.1.1 (2004-10-06):

* (Microsoft Windows version): aven: Hopefully fix loading a survey file at
  startup.

* aven: Delay loading the bitmap for the "About" dialog until it is first
  needed.  We want start up to be as quick as possible.

Changes between 1.0.32 and 1.1.0 (never formally released):

* NOTE: Survex 1.1.X releases are development snapshots made available for
  the purposes of allowing wider testing and getting more user feedback.  Once
  the code has stabilised the version number will be raised to 1.2.0.

* aven: Now uses OpenGL for 3d rendering - you may need to install drivers if
  you're using Windows 95 - these can be obtained from:
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/info/1/W95/EN-US/Opengl95.exe

* aven: Solid passages - passage dimensions are currently inferred from
  the leg length (pretty effective as you can measure longer legs in
  larger passages).  Use of real LRUD data coming soon...

* aven: Depth colouring is now continuously varying.

* aven: Colour by depth can now be turned off (and there's the start of a
  framework for properly implementing colour by date, error, etc).

* aven: Find stations moved onto the toolbar and now uses a simple wildcarded
  match (? matches any character, * matches any number of characters).

* aven: We now use the status bar for coordinates, distances, etc to make
  better use of screen space.

* aven: Full screen mode (F11).

* aven: Perspective view.

* aven: Context sensitive cursor shape - needs more work.

* aven: Mouse actions changed (hopefully they're now more natural, but
  you may find the change disorientating - feedback wanted on this).

* aven: Added "presentations" which allow you to set up fly-through paths
  and load/save/run them.

* aven: A presentation can be exported as a movie file.

* aven: Added Save screenshot facility.

* aven: Depth fogging option.

* aven: Added Smooth Lines option.

* aven: Added Textured Walls option.

* aven: If a survey has surface legs but no underground legs, default to
  showing the surface legs.

* cavern: Dates given to *date are now stored in the 3d file.
