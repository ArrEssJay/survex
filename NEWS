Changes in 1.0.8:

* aven: reduced memory usage and increased speed and responsiveness.

* aven: rate of rotation and switching between plan and elevation now adjusted
  to the speed of redraw, so aven behaves in a similar way independent of the
  speed of the computer or size of the survey.

* aven: provide list of most recently loaded files (preserved between runs of
  the program).

* aven: settings for "Metric" and "Degrees" are preserved between runs.

* aven: moved some menu items from "View" to "Controls" as they probably
  belong there and the "View" menu was getting out of hand.

* aven: cursor keys now translate cave in the same way the mouse does (i.e. now
  work as in caverot and xcaverot).

* aven: eliminated the "twinkling label" effect when dragging the cave with the
  right mouse button.

* aven: the measuring line moves much more smoothly now - it only redraws the
  area of the window affected by it moving.

* print*: added --raw switch to turn of info box, scale bar, and page footer.
  This can be useful if you want to import the output into another application.
  
* print*: improved output when --no-border is used.

* printpcl/printdm: Added new .ini setting "font_bitmap" which allows the user
  to choose between alternative fonts.  Current we supply "default" and "bold".

* cavern: added support for BackCompass and BackClino (FIXME: working, but
  not finished).

* cavern: fixed handling of omitted clino readings when OMIT is *set to be
  different from MINUS and PLUS (new test omitclino).

* cavern: N-S, E-W, and vertical ranges now only count stations which are in
  underground surveys.

* cavern: *infer plumbs wasn't inferring -90 to be DOWN - fixed.

* cavern: fixed a bogus warning for any station which was only used in a line
  of data which was rejected because of an error.

* cavern: removed the ill-thought-out and never implemented LENGTHOUTPUT
  and ANGLEOUTPUT quantities.

* Slovak translation added; updated de, ca, es.

* ChangeLog now only includes entries since the previous release (the full file
  is 220K or so, and of interest to very few people).  MSDOS and MS Windows
  versions now comfortably fit on a 1.44M floppy once again.

* Test suite now checks that programs will run with "--help" and "--version".
  This should avoid problems such as that which broke the printer drivers in
  1.0.4-1.0.6.

Changes in 1.0.7:

* print*: halted with a failed assertion in 1.0.4-1.0.6.

Changes in 1.0.6:

* aven: "Reverse Controls" now works as in xcaverot and caverot.

* aven: free rotation mode (engage by pressing control while left dragging,
  exit with Delete) improved.

* aven: using File->Open when a file was already loaded caused a crash
  if a station was "grey highlighted" in the survey tree - fixed.

* aven: added hourglass for "find" operation.

* aven: reenabled loading of files by drag-and-drop (accidentally disabled
  in 1.0.4 and 1.0.5).

* aven: improved handling of flat surveys (e.g. output of extend, surveys
  with no clino information).

* aven: surveys with stations but no legs no longer cause the labels and
  crosses buttons to behave oddly.

* aven: removed quite a bit of unused and superfluous code.

* Spell-checked documentation.

Changes in 1.0.5:

* Fixed bug in img_open_survey() which could cause a crash if you tried to
  open an unrecognised file (i.e. not .3d, .pos, .plt, or .xyz format).

* North and East were the wrong way round when reading in .plt files.

* cad3d: Improved .plt file output a little - there's probably enough file
  structure for Compass to read them now.

* Documentation updates.

Changes in 1.0.4:

* extend: previously only kept one name for an equated group of stations in the
  extended .3d file; now keeps all the names.

* cad3d: if an output filename is given, use its extension to pick the default
  output format.

* aven: movement with keyboard is now accelerated by Shift as in caverot.

* print*: --no-borders fixed to work as documented; --no-cutlines added to
  turn off the dashed lines where pages join on multi-page printouts.

* aven: tracked down two uninitialised variables which seems to fix the
  failure to load a survey on startup which some people have been experiencing
  on Microsoft Windows.

* aven: code cleaned up - should improve performance a little.

* img routines: img_rewind() now returns a value indicating success/failure.

* Improvements to .plt file reading, notably that distances in the file are
  now interpreted as being in feet rather than metres.  Also .plt files should
  now be recognised even with a different extension, and we cope with an odd
  special case better.

* Added support for reading CMAP XYZ files.  There are two variants of these
  - the "shot" format is fully implemented, the "station" format currently
  just reads the station names and positions - the legs are ignored (sadly
  the sample files I have do not match the format specification).

* (MacOS X version): aven: aven now builds on MacOS X - we just need to sort
  out packaging now...

* (MSDOS version): upgraded graphics library used to Allegro 4.0.1.

* Documentation updates.

Changes in 1.0.3:

* aven: you can now select distances to be displayed in feet (or miles when
  you zoom right out) instead of metres, and angles to be in grads instead
  of degrees.

* aven: show altitude of mouse pointer when in elevation view.

* cad3d: fixed bug which caused --plt to crash on some platforms.

* print*: added "Printing to `XXX'..." message to say where output is being
  written.

* Updated French translation; minor updates to other translations (mostly
  sorting out clashing menu shortcuts in aven).

* (Unix version): assorted portability tweaks.

Changes in 1.0.2:

* printdm/printpcl/printwin: take notice of font_size_labels setting in
  print.ini etc.

* cavern: Topofil can now be used with DIVING and CYLPOLAR styles; TOPOFIL
  style is now synonymous with NORMAL.

* cavern: *INFER EQUATES and *DATA TOPOFIL now work together correctly.

* cavern: *FIX with 3 standard deviations but no covariances now works.

* (Mac OS X version): command line programs now build.  We're working on Aven.

* Updates to the Catalan and Spanish translations.

* xcaverot: documented environmental variables XCAVEROT_INDICATOR_RADIUS and
  XCAVEROT_FONTNAME.

* cad3d: added --plt option to produce crude approximation to Compass .plt
  files - should be good enough for reading into Carto.

* img library enhanced to allow Compass .plt files to be read as if they were
  .3d files.

Changes in 1.0.1:

* (MS Windows version): printwin: fixed sizes of cross and page alignment
  ticks.

* Updates to the Portuguese and Italian translations.

Changes in 1.0.0:

* Fixed --survey option supported by many programs which was broken in 0.99.

* aven: altered colours of "fixed points" and "entrances" buttons to match
  the coloured blobs used to indicate them.

* (MS Windows version): aven: changed current point highlighting in the
  survey tree to use a light grey background rather than bold (bold causes
  the text to "wriggle" as the highlight runs up or down).

* (MS Windows version): file icons now have transparent backgrounds.

* survex: removed conversion wrapper - you should use "cavern file.svx"
  instead of "survex file.svx".

* (Unix version): GCC 2.95 sometimes fails with an internal error when trying
  to compile gfxcore.cc - if it does, the Makefile will now try recompiling
  with a lower optimisation level.

* (Unix version): when doing an "in directory" build from source, the HTML
  manual is now installed in its own subdirectory as when doing a non
  "in directory" build.

* German translation now completely up-to-date.
