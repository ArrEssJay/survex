Changes in 0.92-prerelease6:

* Windows and MSDOS builds were missing 3dtodxf.exe

* Updated French, German, Portugese, and Italian translations

* Windows archive for pre5 contained Linux binaries! (except caverot)

Changes in 0.92-prerelease5:

* printps: now allow separate font sizes (and fonts) for station
  labels and other text

* print*/print.ini: allow different outputs to be specified for each
  operating system with sensible defaults in print.ini

* print.ini: major overhaul of layout to improve readability

* Another regression test case added

* HACKING: new file containing nuggets of wisdom for developers

* Added default s.d. for level legs

* Fixed network reduction bug (undoing network simplifications didn't
  always restore removed stations to the station list)

* Catch *begin with no matching *end

* Catch *begin and matching *end in different files

* Updated Portugese, French, and German translations [Leandro/Eric/Gerhard]

* Wrong warning was being given for `*equate 1 1'

* xcaverot: fixed "step" button and keys

* caverot: reduced exe size down to slightly more than 0.91 (allegro issue)

Changes in 0.92-prerelease4:

* cavern: "*infer" wasn't working due to internal token value mismatch

* Short usage information now directs user to "--help"

* print.ini: Tidied up comments about font size and line width for
  printps

* printps: Line width now set correctly for all pages with ghostview

* cavern: Fixed problem with highly *equate-d nodes (introduced in
  0.92-pre1)

* aven: Fixed redraw errors; enabled splash screen [mark]

* cavern: Fixed deltastar network transformation to handle covariances

* More test cases added to catch any regressions of recent bug fixes

* Include alien.pl in distibution (helper script for compiling with
  BorlandC and on RISC OS)

* cavern: tests for zero now use epsilon related tests, apart for on
  RISC OS where the FP emulation appears to cut corners and give
  slightly incorrect answers.

* Now include Postscript version of documentation

* HTML documentation now uses ".htm" extension instead of ".html" to
  placate crap unzip programs which can't handle anything over 8.3

* NEWS now describes user-visible changes; ChangeLog is now
  autogenerated from the CVS commit messages

Changes in 0.92-prerelease3:

* xcaverot: Switching between plan and elevation now smoother

* xcaverot: Fixed poor handling of keypresses when rotating

* xcaverot: Reenabled buttons and made plan/elev button work properly

* aven: New experimental gtk-based xcaverot replacement

Changes in 0.92-prerelease2:

* Can now just run individual tests from test suite

* cavern: Turned off stray debugging output in matrix.c

* Improved various bits of debug code

* cavern: Fixed minor problems when compiling with NO_COVARIANCES

* In test suite, cavern failing now causes test to fail immediately

* Include riscos/config.h.in and borlandc/config.h.in in distribution

* cavern: Fixed bug when finding articulation points in a component
  with more than one fixed point

Changes in 0.92-prerelease1:

* caverot: Help screen incorrectly documented tilt as '/' and ':' -
  actually it's on '/' and ''' (single quote)

* caverot: Previously assumed shift-singlequote is '@' which is true
  on UK keyboards but not on US keyboards.  Quick fix: check both '@'
  and '"' for now.

* "printps -b" now reports "option requires an argument" (used to segfault)

* Updated printer driver command line options in manual

* caverot: Fixed shift key to accelerate movements in allegro version

* cavern: Disabled articulation point code (for now - there's a bug)

* cavern: If a datafile isn't found, now try a lowercase version
  before giving up (so on Unix you can now process a DOS dataset by
  unpacking with "unzip -L" to force filenames of unpacked files to
  lower case)

* diffpos: Fixed a couple of bugs; also now exits with status 1 if
  differences were reported

* Added some tests for cavern and diffpos - more to follow

* cavern: Covariance code now working and enabled by default

* cavern: When equating two existing stations we need to replace the
  pos of one with the pos of the other.  We used to look down the
  whole station list, now we just look at neighbouring nodes
  (noticable time saving for large networks with many equates)

* cavern: Renamed truncate function in commands.c to avoid clash with
  library truncate function on FreeBSD

* cavern: Warn that *prefix and *default are deprecated

* Fixed obscure problems when configure is rerun with a different prefix

* If the environmental variable SURVEXLANG isn't set, LANG is now
  check before resorting to the default.  LANG is a standard way to
  specify the language for GNU applications - SURVEXLANG is still
  useful as a way to specify an alternate language if Survex doesn't
  support your prefered language.

* Cured superfluous copy of svxdocs in doc/svxdocs in source distribution

* RISC OS and BorlandC builds now track copyright message and version
  number automatically

* If LANG is set to "en_US", treat it as if it were "en-us"

* xcaverot: Merged in changes from John Pybus and Mark Shinwell

* cavern: *solve followed by some entirely unconnected survey now
  caught cleanly (used to hit an assert)

* cavern: Corrected component and loop counts when there's hanging
  survey around

Changes in 0.91:

* Fixed problem with message files with accented characters

* Fixed RISC OS specific problem if SURVEXLANG was set

* xcaverot: Fixed to centre and scale cave on startup

* Removed superfluous containing directory for RISC OS documentation

Changes in 0.90:

* caverot: MSDOS Allegro mode-picker now reappears if an invalid mode
  is chosen (caverot used to unhelpfully exit in this case).

* caverot: Fixed cursor keys and delete in MSDOS Allegro version

* fixed problem with US English messages

* text files in DOS/Win32 zips now have ".txt" extension and DOS
  end-of-lines

* 3dtodxf: Leandro Dybal Bertoni has made major improvements to
  DXF output

* caverot: Right and Middle mouse button functions were swapped under
  RISC OS

* caverot: BorlandC (pre-386) version wasn't erasing screen between redraws

* HTML version of documentation now has a hyperlinked table of
  contents

Changes in 0.90 beta3:

* cavern: output files now go in current directory rather than the
  same directory where the first .svx file is found.  You can set a
  different directory using the "--output" command line option, which
  can point to a directory or a file.

* cavern: "*truncate off" rather than "*truncate 0"

* survex: added wrapper to convert survex invocation into cavern invocation

* hto filters moved into separate subdirectory of source distribution

* cavern: fixed bug which included stations with 4 or more connections
  in the .3d file several times

* added "miniam.pl" which generates makefiles for BorlandC and RISC OS

* printdm/printpcl: weren't showing text - problem with new format
  font file

* check for old SURVEXLANG codes (engi, fren, germ, ...) now case
  insensitive

Changes in 0.90 beta2:

* xcaverot: Fixed to handle > 2048 stations/legs

In 0.90 alpha4:

* printps: made postscript bounding box slightly larger

* printps: tweaked postscript output to reduce size (5% smaller for
  Kaninchenhoehle)

In 0.90 alpha3:

* fixed bogus "Error writing printer output" message from printer drivers

* minor cosmetic fixes to printer drivers

* printps: added postscript bounding box

* cavern: Halt after 50 errors to save swamping user

* now use GNU getopt to parse command line options

* cavern: -f and @ removed

* cavern: -n, -t and -u replaced by *-commands

* source code tidied up considerably

* new format message files - now internally use unicode (in UTF-8) and
  should be faster and smaller

* new format font file for printdm/printpcl (faster and smaller)

* cavern: GCC format error/warning messages to allow clicking on
  messages to jump to the problem line in editors which support it
  (e.g. GNU emacs and jed)

* Now uses GNU automake under Unix which makes my life a lot easier and also
  provides "make install"

* xcaverot: now checks for failing to open the X display

Changes in 0.81:

* survex: Network reduction bug fixed (fix carried back from 0.90 development)

Changes between prerelease3 and 0.80:

* Set version to 0.80 (since this is a release candidate)

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* caverot: Fixed 32-bit DOS keyboard and mouse initialisation problems

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has stripped .exe files once more, and so
  is rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work
