* Caverot help screen incorrectly documented tilt as '/' and ':' - actually
  it's on '/' and ''' (single quote)

* Caverot assumed shift-singlequote is '@' which is true on UK keyboards but
  not on US keyboards.  Quick fix: check both '@' and '"' for now.

* "printps -b" now reports "option requires an argument" (used to segfault)

* Updated printer driver command line options in manual

* Fixed shift key to accelerate movements in allegro version of caverot

* Cleaned up network reduction code and split into netskel.c and network.c

* Removed svxmacro.c

* Disabled articulation point code (for now - there's a bug)

* If a datafile isn't found, cavern will now try a lowercase version before
  giving up (so on Unix you can now process a DOS dataset by unpacking with
  "unzip -L" to force filenames of unpacked files to lower case).

* Fixed a couple of bugs in diffpos, and it now exits with status 1 if
  differences were reported

* Added some tests for cavern and diffpos - more to follow

* Covariance code now working and enabled by default

* When equating two existing stations we need to replace the pos of one with
  the pos of the other.  We used to look down the whole station list, now we
  just look at neighbouring nodes (noticable time saving for large networks
  with many equates)

* Renamed truncate function in commands.c to avoid clash with library
  truncate function on FreeBSD

* Warn that *prefix and *default are deprecated

* Fixed obscure problems when configure is rerun with a different prefix

* If the environmental variable SURVEXLANG isn't set, LANG is now
  check before resorting to the default.  LANG is a standard way to
  specify the language for GNU applications - SURVEXLANG is still
  useful as a way to specify an alternate language if Survex doesn't
  support your prefered language.

* Cured superfluous copy of svxdocs in doc/svxdocs in source distribution

* RISC OS and BorlandC builds now track copyright message and version
  number automatically

Changes in 0.91:

* Fixed problem with message files with accented characters

* Fixed RISC OS specific problem if SURVEXLANG was set

* Fixed xcaverot to centre and scale cave on startup

* Removed superfluous containing directory for RISC OS documentation

Changes in 0.90:

* MSDOS caverot mode-picker now reappears if an invalid mode is chosen
  (caverot used to unhelpfully exit in this case).

* Fixed cursor keys and delete in MSDOS caverot

* corrected 2 C++ comments in xrot.h

* fixed en_us.msg to en-us.msg in lib/Makefile.am

* text files in DOS/Win32 zips now have ".txt" extension and DOS end-of-lines

* Leandro Dybal Bertoni has made major improvements to 3dtodxf's DXF output

* Right and Middle mouse button functions were swapped under RISC OS

* pre-386 caverot wasn't erasing screen between redraws

* HTML version of documentation now has a table of contents (with hyperlinks)

Changes in 0.90 beta3:

* output files now go in current directory rather than the same directory
  where the first .svx file is found.  You can set a different directory
  using the "--output" command line option, which can point to a directory
  or a file.

* "*truncate off" rather than "*truncate 0"

* added wrapper to convert survex invocation into cavern invocation

* hto filters moved into separate subdirectory of source distribution

* fixed bug which included stations with 4 or more connections in the .3d
  file several times

* added "miniam.pl" which generates makefiles for BorlandC and RISC OS

* printdm/printpcl weren't showing text - problem with new format font file

* check for old SURVEXLANG codes (engi, fren, germ, ...) now case insensitive

Changes in 0.90 beta2:

* Fixed xcaverot to handle > 2048 stations/legs

* Spanish and Catalan translations updated (only French left to do)

Changes in 0.90 beta1:

* German, Italian, and Portugese translations updated

* Linux binaries included (x86 RPM)

* Documentation brought largely up to date

In 0.90 alpha5:

* comment parsing fix

* network reduction bug fixed

* new messages extracted for translation

* much smaller postscript output

* real circles in postscript output

* nicer infobox on printouts

* caverot help page improved

* scale units on printout bug fixed

In 0.90 alpha4:

* made postscript bounding box slightly larger

* tweaked postscript output to reduce size (5% smaller for Kaninchenhoehle)

In 0.90 alpha3:

* fixed bogus "Error writing printer output" message from printer drivers

* minor cosmetic fixes to printer drivers

* added postscript bounding box

* fixed extra "%"s in postscript output

* removed stray debug messages from cavern added in alpha2

In 0.90 alpha2:

* fixed memory allocation bug (affected *include and *title)

In 0.90 alpha1:

* Halt after 50 errors to save swamping user

* now use GNU getopt to parse command line options

* -f and @ removed

* -n, -t and -u replaced by *-commands

* source code tidied up considerably

* new format message files - now internally use unicode (in UTF-8) and
  should be faster and smaller

* new format font file for printdm/printpcl (faster and smaller)

* GCC format error/warning messages to allow clicking on messages to jump to
  the problem line in editors which support it (e.g. GNU emacs and jed)

* Now uses GNU automake under Unix which makes my life a lot easier and also
  provides "make install"

* xcaverot now checks for failing to open the X display

Changes in 0.81:

* Network reduction bug fixed (fix carried back from 0.90 development)

Changes between prerelease3 and 0.80:

* Set version to 0.80 (since this is a release candidate)

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* Fixed 32-bit DOS caverot keyboard and mouse initialisation problems

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has stripped .exe files once more, and so
  is rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work
