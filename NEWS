Changes in 1.0.1:

* (MS Windows version): printwin: fixed sizes of cross and page alignmenti
  ticks.

* Updates to the Portuguese and Italian translations.

Changes in 1.0.0:

* Fixed --survey option supported by many programs which was broken in 0.99.

* aven: altered colours of "fixed points" and "entrances" buttons to match
  the coloured blobs used to indicate them.

* (MS Windows version): aven: changed current point highlighting in the
  survey tree to use a light grey background rather than bold (bold causes
  the text to "wriggle" as the highlight runs up or down).

* (MS Windows version): file icons now have transparent backgrounds.

* survex: removed conversion wrapper - you should use "cavern file.svx"
  instead of "survex file.svx".

* (Unix version): GCC 2.95 sometimes fails with an internal error when trying
  to compile gfxcore.cc - if it does, the Makefile will now try recompiling
  with a lower optimisation level.

* (Unix version): when doing an "in directory" build from source, the HTML
  manual is now installed in its own subdirectory as when doing a non
  "in directory" build.

* German translation now completely up-to-date.

Changes in 0.99:

* Fixed bug in .3d file reading code which would incorrectly reconstruct
  the survey hierarchy in rare cases.

* (MS Windows version): aven: fixed redraw problem for "N found".

* (MS Windows version): minor tweaks to .err, .pos, and .svx file icons.

* (Unix version): aven: Highlight of current station restores old background
  colour correctly rather than assuming it's white.

* aven: Resolved a number of menu shortcut clashes.

* (RISC OS version): fixed automatic detection of language.

* cavern: improved error reporting from *data; better handling of some
  incorrect usages of *sd and *units.

* Italian translation updated.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease9:

* aven: Side Panel can now be dragged or toggled shut and then reopened
  again; double-clicking on the divider now maximises the survey window rather
  than the side panel.

* aven: .3d files can now be loaded using "drag and drop" from MS Windows
  Explorer, and X filemanagers which support XDND (e.g. Konqueror).

* aven: fixed problems with selection handling in survey tree.

* aven: Escape cancels distance measuring line; suppress distance measuring
  line during auto-rotation and animated tilting.

* aven: entrance blobs now green to distinguish them from stations matching
  search.

* aven: problems with dragging scalebar fixed.

* (MS Windows version): aven: Loading file on start-up now works!

* (MS Windows version): aven: Delete now works in the search box.

* (Unix version): aven: Highlight current station in tree with grey background
  (don't seem to be able to use bold like we do on MS Windows).

* cavern: Fixed handling of interleaved nosurvey data.

* cavern: Diving and cylpolar styles now take DEPTHCHANGE where they used to
  take DZ.

* (MS Windows version): Installer now uses a different compression
  method (bzip2) which reduces the download size by about 5% (and 
  should help keep the installer small enough to fit on a 1.44M floppy).
  Bzip2 is a little slower to uncompress, but not appreciably so on the
  machines I've checked it on.

* (MS Windows version): Should now install without errors for a
  non-admin user on MS Windows NT/2000/XP.

* (MS Windows version): Installer should now allow installation on NT 3.51.

* Updated manual (notably added documentation for interleaved data styles).

* German and Brazillian Portuguese translations updated.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease8:

* aven: Ctrl + Arrow keys is now the preferred way to rotate and tilt
  (easier to remember than "C"/"V" and "'"/"/").

* aven: survey pane now gets initial focus so you no longer have to
  click on it before key presses are recognised.

* (MS Windows version): aven: fixed problems with some keys being
  impossible to enter in search box, or not being recognised in survey
  pane.

* (MS Windows version): aven: wxWindows messages files were missing.  We
  now include them for languages which Survex also supports.

* (MS DOS version): caverot: Shift and/or Ctrl + Arrow keys now works.

* aven: Close button in About box is now always right in the bottom right
  corner.

* Display copyright symbol rather than (C) where the current character set
  allows it.

* (MS DOS version): caverot: default to 320x200 when running under
  Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP as we already do on NT.

* (MS DOS version): fixed problem when running on DOS outside MS Windows.

* (MS DOS version): detect current codepage rather than assuming it's 850.
  We now support codepages 437 and 850 (the common ones) - for other
  codepages we fall back to using 7-bit ASCII.

* (Unix version): aven: now compiles cleanly with GCC3.0.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease7:

* (MS Windows version): aven was missing from 0.99-prerelease6
  (if you installed over an old version you'd have kept the old aven).

* caverot/xcaverot: Ctrl + Arrow keys is now the preferred way to
  rotate and tilt (easier to remember than "C"/"V" and "'"/"/").

* xcaverot: Shift-ed movement keys now work faster as in caverot.

* cavern: fixed *calibrate depth/todepth/fromdepth/dz and *units dz to
  work in data styles diving and cylpolar.

* cavern: fixed handling of malformed *data commands.

* Various documentation clarifications.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease6:

* aven: fixed bogus lines caused by coordinate wrap-around; fixed
  problem in repeated zoom with [ or ]; tweaked layout and auto-sizing
  of left panel; station search now case insensitive; regexp search
  enabled; suppressed message box when wxWindows doesn't support the
  language Survex is set to use; fixed obscure crash in search
  highlighting; added "rubber band" between measured stations;
  Improved choice of menu short-cuts in translations.

* (MS Windows version): don't include plain text versions of docs; fixed
  default action for 3d files to be "Open".

* (MS DOS version): include text docs.

* cavern: more intelligent and less verbose reporting of errors in nested
  included files (inspired by GCC 3.0).

* cavern: improved reporting of syntax errors in survey data.

* print*: improved reporting of invalid scales; interpret a single
  number less than one as the scale in the obvious way (so "0.001"
  means "1:1000").

* print*: "--crosses" no longer prevents "--station-names" from working.

* print*: if running interactively, prompt for what elements to plot
  when run so MS Windows users don't have to resort to the command line.

* Improved documentation for print.ini; Other minor documentation updates.

* (Unix version) configure auto-probe for wxWindows updated to cope
  with wxWindows version 2.2.8 (still works with older versions too).

* Diving and cylpolar styles now accept dz (change in depth) rather than
  requiring absolute depths and taking the difference.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease5:

* aven: improved initial sizing of window; "Toggle rotation" toolbar
  icon now works; handle files with only stations better; presentation
  code disabled for 1.0; releasing mouse over menubar now ends drag;
  don't highlight hidden stations; accelerator problems fixed; find now
  works.

* (MS Windows version) aven: fixed crash on File/Open when a file was
  already loaded.

* cavern: After *solve, reused points are no longer written to the .3d
  file a second time.

* cavern: Warn that the undocumented extra "omit" allowed by *data is
  deprecated.

* cavern: Give error if standard deviation argument to *sd isn't
  positive.

* Consistent capitalisation of --help option descriptions.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease4:

* Minor improvements to manual and Unix man pages.

* printps/printhpgl/printwin: --skip-blanks fixed.

* printhpgl: fixed paper size for A1 landscape (was actually A2
  portrait!)

* (MSDOS version): graphics in HTML manual were corrupted (by being
  packed as text).

* (RISC OS version): graphics were missing from HTML manual.

* (RISC OS version and 286 DOS version): fixed programs to report
  themselves as part of "Survex" rather than "@PRETTYPACKAGE@".

* (MSDOS version): pick a default language for messages by looking at the
  currently set country.

* (Unix version): Improved test for whether build needs librx - before
  it was used if it was present, even if it wasn't needed.

* (Unix version): Assorted minor debian tweaks.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease3:

* Documentation rearranged.  Some sections which covered the same
  ground have been merged, and the documentation for each program is
  now available as a man page under Unix.

* (Unix version): Fixed problem with incomplete versions being
  specified in debian package dependencies.

* (Unix version): Fixed problems with not having librx on Linux (it's
  now built into libc).

Changes in 0.99-prerelease2:

* aven: fixed bug which caused occasional crash during mouse movement;
  station identifying didn't work after a resize until the survey was
  moved.

* Asking for messages in language en_GB now tries language en as it
  was meant to.

* printps/printhpgl/printwin: fixed typo which made --skip-blanks get
  it wrong in some rare cases.

* (Unix version): Added man pages for 3dtopos and sorterr.

* (Unix version): More minor tweaks to debian packages.

* Include images with HTML documentation; other minor documentation
  changes.

Changes in 0.99-prerelease1:

* Major clean-up of Survex Manual; renamed from "svxdocs" to "manual".

* Text documentation converted to HTML; BUGS and TODO merged, ZOMBIES
  removed.

* Include HTML documentation overview page and manual in all versions
  (was only included in MS Windows before).

* aven: added new functionality: toolbar, side panel with survey tree,
  find station, measure distance between two stations, click on
  station to centre.

* aven: can now create presentations consisting of a set of views with
  movements between them.  Useful for using aven as a "slide show" in
  a conference talk.

* aven: handles loading file from command line better.

* cavern: added error checks for "*flags" (with no arguments) and
  "*flags not".

* cavern: you can now specify optional covariances to *FIX.

* cavern: parser fixed to recover from errors as intended in a few
  situations where it was failing to.

* cavern: implemented covariances for diving data.

* cavern: added "cylpolar" data style - similar to diving, except the
  tape is measured horizontally rather than along the slope of the leg.

* cavern: complain about *export-ing or *entrance-ing a station which
  is never used.

* cavern: complain about *export after a *begin without an argument.

* cavern: use *title only if at top of survey tree, else generate
  title from filename(s).

* cavern: removed dummy *lrud command which was added for tunnel but
  isn't used by tunnel.

* cavern: round coordinates to nearest cm when writing .3d file.

* cavern: fixed reporting of node stats for stations fixed with error
  estimates.

* cavern: no longer generate a .inf file - the .log file generated by
  the --log option makes the .inf file obsolete.

* cavern: only apply special pathname handling to filenames in
  *include, not those on the command line.

* cavern: *date now checks its argument.  It expects an ISO format date
  (e.g. 2001.09.13) or range (e.g. 2001.09.12-2001.09.13).  For cases
  where the exact date isn't know, the day and month can be omitted -
  e.g. 2001.09 and 2001 are also valid.

* cavern: --new-format renamed to --chasm-format.

* print*: If restricting to a subsurvey, use that survey name for the
  title of the printout.

* print*: Detect .3d files produced by extend and handle them more
  appropriately (don't ask for view or bearing, and modify info box
  on printout).

* print*: --skip-blanks now works on printwin/printpcl/printps;
  --skip-blanks now forces --no-border.

* printps: thinner lines by default (0.1 points rather than 0.5).

* printdm: added --calibrate option to print calibration page; if
  there's no calibration in the .ini file, refuse to print (apart
  from calibration pages) rather than printing to the wrong scale.

* printwin: removed --output option - there is no output file.

* extend: wasn't picking start station as documented - fixed and
  also enhanced to try to find an entrance with legs first.

* survex: conversion wrapper doesn't use --output unless it is actually
  needed, and displays corresponding cavern command line, and (if
  appropriate) file.

* cad3d: added --reduction option (from Leandro) which allows sketch
  output to be scaled down (default scale is 1:500); grid in sketch
  file is now visible by default; default output now goes in the
  current directory. 

* cad3d/3dtopos/sorterr: delete output file if there's an error
  writing to it.

* 3dtopos: minor improvements to sort order.

* hto2svx, svx2hto: Removed HTO support - Survex appears to be the
  only released software to ever have provided support, and an
  exchange format that nobody else supports is useless.

* xcaverot: report more detailed error when .3d file can't be loaded.

* `program --version' now works even if message file can't be found.

* (Unix version): Fixed attempt to load messages from
  "DEFAULTLANG.msg" if both SURVEX_LANG and LANG were unset.

* Much more rigorous checking for operating system errors when reading
  and writing files.

* (RISC OS version): query Territory module to find currently selected
  language, and use that for messages.

* (UNIX version): man pages now have "Survex <version number>" on them;
  fixed minor flaws in man pages.

* Distinguish between a "bad" .3d file and one which has a newer
  revision of the format than we understand.

* img library can now read .pos files as if they were .3d files with
  just stations in, so all programs which can read .3d files can also
  now read .pos files.

* Expanded testsuite further.

* French, Brazillian Portuguese, and German translations brought
  almost completely up-to-date.

* (Unix version): Lots of little improvements to debian packages
  (mostly from Wookey).

Changes in 0.98:

* (MS Windows version): New icons for .svx, .pos, and .err files.
  Tweaked .3d icon to work better in 256 colour modes.

* Added tests for `*infer plumbs' and `*infer equates'.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease6:

* printwin: fixed new bug introduced in 0.98-prerelease4 which caused
  an internal error.

* printwin: exit cleanly if no printer drivers are installed.

* aven: surface surveys weren't being drawn when viewing from above
  (bug introduced in recent version).

* aven/caverot/xcaverot/print*/cadgen/extend/diffpos/3dtopos: --survey
  command line option once more trims specified prefix from station
  names like it did in xcaverot/caverot in 0.98-prerelease4.

* sorterr: Added --replace option to sort the .err file and replace
  the original with the sorted version (for use by MS Windows file
  associations); cope with empty .err file.

* cavern: Added --log option to send output to a .log file.

* cavern: --quiet no longer suppresses node statistics.

* extend: give up if the .3d file is truncated or corrupted part way
  through.

* (MS Windows version): sorterr.exe and 3dtopos.exe were missing;
  improvements to documentation; assorted fixes and improvements to
  file associations.

* print*: reduced memory usage.

* Fixed dropping of first character of survey station names when
  reading old .3d files.

* (MS Windows version): aven.exe wasn't rebuilt for 0.98-prerelease -
  fixed the dodgy script.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease5:

* aven/print*/cadgen/extend/diffpos/3dtopos: Added --survey command
  line option to restrict the operation of the command to a sub-survey
  in the .3d file.

* aven: initial scaling now ignores unused fixed points (unless there
  are no legs at all), and scales survey so it fits inside window.

* aven: can now load a survey with no legs, only stations.

* aven: --version now works, and --help produces more helpful output.

* cavern: fixed bug with eating first character of line after
  interleaved data; corrected line numbers in some situations
  involving interleaved data.

* cavern: fixed problem with points fixed with errors.

* cavern: *title without quotes now stops at a comment; *title with no
  argument no longer allowed - use `*title ""' if you really mean to
  set an empty title.

* Minor documentation updates.

* 3dtopos: Fixed bug which resulted in station names and coordinates
  getting mismatched; output now defaults to current directory.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease4:

* diffpos: list added and deleted stations in sorted order; better
  error reporting.

* 3dtopos: removed hardcoded limit on number of stations (was 100000);
  better error reporting.

* Further tweaks to charset handling - look at LC_* as well as LANG;
  Check GUI codepage under MS Windows.

* cavern: Allow *copyright/*date/*instrument/*team/*title between
  *begin and *export.

* cavern: Fixed typo which prevented *instrument from being recognised
  as a valid command.

* cavern: removed option to produce ascii .3d files.

* cavern: on error, remove any existing .inf file for consistency with
  .3d and .err files.

* cavern: interleaved nosurvey data style now works; nosurvey legs now
  count as a "use" of a fixed point.

* cavern: give at most 5 warnings about use of any particular
  deprecated feature.  Otherwise processing an old dataset just gives
  an avalanche of warnings which buries any other warnings or errors.

* cavern: implemented `*infer equates'.

* aven: if a .3d file is truncated or corrupted part way through, aven
  would previously load part of it without complaint.  Fixed to
  complain and not load anything.

* printwin: fixed problem where it hung when waiting for input.

* print*: Added --output command line option to override the output
  setting in the .ini file (ignored by printwin).

* .3d files now store prefixes for legs (the prefix is taken from the
  "from" station of the leg);  Station names and leg prefixes in .3d
  files are now stored compressed.  Despite now storing prefixes for
  legs, .3d files are now typically 25%-33% smaller than before.

* xcaverot/caverot: Added --survey command line option which restricts
  the view to a sub-survey in the .3d file.  e.g.:
  "caverot --survey 161.dream all.3d"

* (MS Windows version): added explorer bindings for sorterr.

* cavern/xcaverot/sorterr: fixed --help output to include long options.

* Minor documentation updates.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease3:

* cavern/3dtopos: cavern no longer produces .pos files - they're
  mostly useful for hand plotting and are larger than the
  corresponding .3d files so most of the time they slow processing and
  then clutter up the disk.  A new utility 3dtopos produces a .pos
  file from a .3d file, and has the added benefit that it sorts names
  with numbers in numerically (i.e. 2 before 10).

* diffpos: the arguments can now be .pos or .3d files, or one of each.

* cavern: improved parsing of unquoted *include/*title strings - used
  to end at the first literal space; now they end at the first BLANK
  character (space, tab, and comma by default).  So the odd case of an
  unquoted string with commas or tabs will require quotes to be added.

* All versions have been missing RTF, text, and PostScript versions of
  the documentation in the previous 2 prereleases.

* cavern: Fixed articulation code wasn't quite.

* cavern: an empty label was being added to the .3d file for a station
  fixed with standard deviations.  Such labels are also now ignored by
  img on read-in.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease2:

* (MS Windows version): Fixed "Open" on a .3d file to open in aven
  rather than converting to a DXF.  "Convert to DXF" now appears as a
  separate menu item.

* cavern: Fixed bogus errors about matrix not being positive definite.

* cavern: Fixed bug in articulation point code which could result in
  a traverse "exploding" in certain situations (introduced in 0.95).

* cavern: Check for chunks of survey not connected to a fixed point is
  now done earlier on (which simplifies quite a bit of the network
  code).

* xcaverot: Disabled "legs" and "surface" buttons in --pda mode - they
  make the button bar too wide.

Changes in 0.98-prerelease1:

* Covariance matrices are symmetric - now only store 6 of the 9 entries.
  Typically uses 10% less memory and is 15% faster.

* caverot: adjust to speed of machine/size of survey on initial draw,
  rather than on first action from user.

* (MS Windows version): now handle oe-ligatures.

* (Unix version): discover character set by looking at $LANG.

* (MS Windows version): discover character set from Windows.

* Transliterate accented characters that can't be represented in the
  current character set.

* Added support for Latin9 (iso-8859-15) character set.

* printps/printpcl/printwin: Improved handling of accents on printouts.

* aven: added optional grid; dashed surface survey now the default;
  Indicators moved to submenu of View menu.

* aven: reporting errors in a message box wasn't working (wxWindows
  bug).

* cavern: fixed *entrance - it was trying to insist its argument was a
  survey, not a station.

* cavern: a leg with the same station at both ends now causes an error
  rather than just a warning.

* cavern: added station name to "station equated to itself" message.

* cavern: allow interleaved data formats.

* sorterr: new utility for sorting .err files by various criteria.

* xcaverot: buttons now size to widest label; added --pda switch to
  turn off less useful buttons for use on small screens (such as the
  ipaq PDA).

Changes in 0.97:

* Unchanged from 0.97-prerelease7.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease7:

* Messages relating to command line options are now translatable.

* (MS DOS versions): now supply self-extracting zip archives.

* (MS Windows version): after running cavern, wait for a key press
  before closing the window.

* cavern: Very quiet mode (-qq) now produces absolutely no output if
  there are no errors or warnings.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease6:

* (MS Windows version): aven: if there are problems opening the
  message file, report them in a message box rather than printing text
  which the user will never see.

* cavern: invalid data lines weren't being counted, so you'd get
  incorrect line numbers reported for further errors and warnings.

* cavern: Added a SPLAY flag for indicating splay shots in chambers
  and large passages.

* extend: ignore surface legs and splay legs; preserve duplicate flag
  on extended legs.

* print*: if surface data isn't being plotted, ignore surface survey
  stations too, and select page layout based on underground data only.

* (MS Windows version): get default language from Windows.

* cavern: added *entrance command for indicating cave entrances.

* Added "surface", "underground", "exported", "fixed", and "entrance"
  station flags to 3d format.

* (DOS version): caverot: fixed bug Brian Clipstone reported where
  caverot would lock up when trying to plot a label off-screen.

* xcaverot/caverot: tweaked sense of a few controls to be consistent
  with each other and with aven.

* Strip leading '\' from station names read from old .3d files.

* cavern: Better reporting of error stats involving a station fixed
  with errors.

* aven: allow highlighting of fixed, exported, and entrance stations.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease5:

* survex: conversion wrapper now only creates __svxtmp.svx file if it
  has to - simple cases (such as "survex example.svx") don't need one;
  also always print warning that user should be using cavern instead.

* Minor updates to documentation.

* Survey stations names are no longer displayed with a leading '\' -
  this doesn't make sense now that root is deprecated, and didn't make
  much sense before to be honest.

* cavern: *fix with two standard deviations (horizontal and vertical)
  was being rejected - fixed.

* cavern: Fixed bug with station "\" appearing in the .err file for
  a station fixed with error estimates.

* (non-Unix versions): remove path and extension and lower-case program
  name for use in error reporting.

* (MS Windows version): added documentation overview page to HTML
  help.

* Removed 255 character limit on station names in .3d and .3dx files.

* caverot: overlapping label code wasn't allowing enough for vertical
  overlap.

* cavern: after a bad *data command, ignore survey data until the next
  valid *data command.

* printdm/printpcl: exit cleanly if bitmap font file is missing.

* cavern: give a more helpful error on empty "*export" or "*prefix".

* xcaverot: Fixed display of surface legs and related minor issues.

* print*: Fixed handling of surface legs; `-S' now recognised as a
  short-form for `--surface'.

* Added test of *solve command.

* cavern: Added commands *date, *team, *instrument, *copyright -
  currently these are ignored, but they provide a place to put data
  when importing/exporting, and will be processed in future versions.

* (MS Windows version): aven updated to same codebase as Unix version.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease4:

* Updated Portuguese and German translations.

* aven: Accents now work in display; suppress "wxstd" warning box for
  English; speed improvements; redesign of indicators; rescale by
  dragging scalebar; allow surface legs to be hidden (they are by
  default); now defaults to plan view; depth bar labelling improved;
  added caverot-like handling of flat surveys (so output from extend
  is locked flat).

* cavern: Complain if the same name is used for a survey and a station.

* cavern: Added --warnings-are-errors command line option.

* caverot/xcaverot: Middle button now tilts cave by dragging rather
  than toggling plan/elevation.

* caverot: continue setup in background while help page is displayed;
  "R" (Reverse Rotation) now only affects the auto-rotation - it used
  to affect "C", "V", "/", and "'".

* cavern: unused fix point warnings now work for stations fixed with
  error estimates; added test cases for this.

* testsuite: Enhanced many existing tests to check for warnings.

* Fixed to build on Solaris with Sun's compiler.

* Minor corrections to documentation and man pages.

* cavern: report *export errors at the file and line where the *begin
  for the survey involved was as that's much more useful.

* cavern: allow "-" in station names by default.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease3:

* (Unix version): aven: Internationalised; Fixed serious drawing bug
  causing incorrect rendering and segfaults; Scale bar now draggable;
  Depth bar tidied up; Orientation menu changes; Menu accelerators
  fixed; Status bar disabled (various continuing problems and it
  doesn't really convey much useful info anyway); About box fixes;
  Fixed crashes on mouse actions when no survey loaded; Improved
  labelling of scale bar and indicators.

* Created Swiss German and "German German" sub-versions of German
  translation.

* (DOS version): caverot: fixed slight underallocation of memory which
  probably caused the bug Brian Clipstone reported.

* cavern: Improved reporting of missing *export-s; added 2 more
  *export tests.

* No longer trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) or SIGTERM (Ctrl-\ on Unix) as we
  can't do anything useful.

* Removed support for really old language names ("fren", "germ",
  "ital", etc) - use "fr", "de", "it", etc instead.

* (RISC OS version): support a few extra accents in messages.

* "Syntax" in command-line help messages now translated.

Changes in 0.97-prerelease2:

* cad3d: Fixed output from `--help'; -e, -D, -S short options now work;
  fixed infinite loop bug.

* (Unix version): aven: leaving "about" box no longer causes segfault;
  toggle status bar now works; N/S/E/W selects view rather than moving
  cave; window close now works; now have ticks on appropriate menu
  items; fixed problems with rendering (some legs missing!); 3d file
  specified on command line now loaded; fixed occasional hangs; fixed
  terrible slowness during rotation; implemented indicators; various
  other bugs fixed.

* Updated translations: pt de it (and fr partially)

* Added tests for most commands and various other cases.

* cavern: fixed *case (correct args are PRESERVE/TOUPPER/TOLOWER) and
  upper/lower were swapped.

* Documentation brought more up-to-date.

* caverot/xcaverot: fix missing end of list marker for surface data
  which typically resulted in a few extra bogus surface legs appearing.

* printer drivers: fixed .ini file reading routine (bug introduced in
  0.97-prerelease 1).

* printps: postscript file meta information now includes the date of
  creation, and also the name of the user running printps (Unix only).

* printer drivers: improved reporting of problems with print.ini files.

* (MSDOS version): fallback DPMI provider and floating point emulator
  were missing in 0.97-prerelease1.

* Better internationalisation - select localised system messages using
  setlocale().

Changes in 0.97-prerelease1:

* extend: fixed bug which resulted in bogus output (added regression test);
  produce binary rather than ASCII .3d output.

* cavern: don't report error stats for articulating traverses.

* (UNIX version): `make uninstall' now removes the HTML documentation.

* (UNIX version): printer drivers: Look for /etc/survex/print.ini rather
  than $SURVEXHOME/myprint.ini

* cavern: added warning that use of ROOT character ('\' by default) is
  deprecated; updated documentation to mention this.

* cavern: added *export command to allow scope of station names to be
  limited.  If *export is never used, behaviour is as before.

* cavern: added *flags command to allow surface surveys and duplicate
  surveys (to be ignored when calculating the total survey length) to be
  indicated.

* new version of 3d file format which can store flags and is slightly more
  compact.  NB New programs can load old .3d files, but old programs can't
  load new .3d files.

* caverot/xcaverot: allow surface legs to be hidden (they are by default)

* cavern: compass can be omitted on legs in diving data to indicate a plumbed
  leg.  In this case the tape and depth gauge readings are combined to give
  the length of the leg.

* cavern: *begin/*prefix reentry warning now gives the original location as
  a separate warning so smart editors will allow you to click on it to jump
  to that file and line.

* printer drivers: put "http://www.survex.com/" on printouts in case someone
  who gets a printout wants to know more about Survex.

* cavern: added easting, northing, altitude added as prefered aliases for
  dx, dy, dz.

* cavern: bug fix: "*prefix \" or "*begin \" would cause an internal error.

* xcaverot: "load" button now works; bearing always shown in range 0-360;
  / and ' now tilt cave; `u' and `d' now switch to view from above/below;
  shift-ed keys now work; `o' now turns off non-overlapping labels;
  `ctrl-L' toggles display of survey legs.

* caverot: n/s/e/w/u/d now work as in xcaverot - the previous functions they
  had weren't actually useful; if memory is really tight, disable
  non-overlapping labels rather than dying with an error.

* prefer balanced quotes (`...') to unbalanced ('...') in messages.

* cavern: file reading errors now treated as fatal; unattached survey error
  now fatal.

* survex: syntax errors in command line arguments now fatal.

* cavern: if there are errors, don't produce output files.

* cavern: bug fix: trying to report certain errors in really long lines could
  cause an internal error.

* 3dtodxf: renamed to cad3d since it can now produce DXF or sketch format.

* aven: rewritten to use wxwindows (under Unix only so far).

* printwin: new native Microsoft Windows printer driver.

* (MS Windows version): new installation wizard.

* Use double precision floating point to pass numbers to/from .3d file
  reading routines to avoid rounding problems.

* cavern: change of terminology - use "reading" instead of "datum",
  since datum more usually means a map datum in surveying.

Changes in 0.96:

* (MSDOS and MS Windows versions): fixed bug in message file handling
  introduced in 0.96-prerelease 1 - symptoms: messages incorrectly looked
  for in current directory, or just printing "???" and exiting.

* cavern: attempting to *include a non-existant file used to complain:
  "In file included from example.svx:31:" / "cavern: Couldn't open data file
  'bad.svx'" - now complain "example.svx:31: Couldn't open data file
  'bad.svx'".

* xcaverot: cursor keys now move the 3D centre of rotation rather than just
  the position of the survey in the window.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease4:

* cavern (RISC OS version): "is this a directory" test would never say
  "yes".

* caverot: (MSDOS version) cursor keys and delete had stopped working (due
  to changes in allegro graphics library) - fixed.

* xcaverot: Zoom in and out with keyboard now behaves exactly like clicking
  on buttons; Removed unused "select" button; Fixed significant memory leak.

* aven: (MS Windows version) Mark Shinwell has written a Microsoft Windows
  version of aven, which is better in almost every way than the directx
  version of caverot (and we're working to fix the few shortfalls), so we've
  shelved directx caverot and are now including aven instead with the MS
  Windows version.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease3:

* caverot: DirectX version for Microsoft Windows.

* caverot: (MSDOS version) 640x480 doesn't work under NT either, but 320x200
  does so default to that instead.

* caverot: --mode-picker option now listed by --help.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease2:

* caverot: (MSDOS version) --mode-picker now recognised anywhere on command
  line (had to be last previously).

* caverot: (MSDOS version) messages from Allegro library now
  internationalised.

* caverot: (MSDOS version) don't try to get 800x600 if running under NT -
  try 640x480 instead.

Changes in 0.96-prerelease1:

* xcaverot: Improved responsiveness; can now load multiple .3d files from
  command line; set defaults (press DELETE) now defaults scale that which
  fits the whole survey on the screen.

* cavern: Fixed bug in DOS and Windows versions with handling of paths
  containing a mixture of "/" and "\".

* 3dtodxf: added "--grid" option (supplied by Leandro); output file now
  defaults to same name as input file but with a ".dxf" extension.

* caverot: now get accents with MSDOS version.

* cavern: applied patch from Leandro to fix problem with diving and topofil
  styles.

* 3dtodxf: can now produce an elevation view with --elevation=ANGLE option.

Changes in 0.95:

* Put aven in a separate RPM package since it depends on a stack of
  libraries which not everyone will want to have to install.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease7:

* Disabled experimental gross-error detection code.

* Now build RPMs (for RedHat Linux - may also work with Mandrake and some
  others).

Changes in 0.95-prerelease6:

* Updated all translations.

* Fixed another logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit
  prefix" check.

* Minor fixes to get MSDOS (djgpp) and MS Windows (mingw) builds working.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease5:

* If no stations are fixed, the first station mentioned is supposed to be.
  But on some platforms (e.g. x86 Linux) the second station was being used
  instead (regression test firststn).

Changes in 0.95-prerelease4:

* Fixed typo which prevented documentation from installing.

* Fixed logic error in "only mentioned once in *equate with explicit prefix"
  check.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease3:

* aven: updated to compile with new cvrotimg.

* More fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease2:

* Minor tweaks to some messages.

* 3dtodxf: Fixed calculation of bounding box if all coordinates are negative
  in one or more axes.

* Added Wookey's man pages - these just list the command line options and
  point to the HTML documentation.

* Fixes for compilation problems on non-Linux UNIX platforms.

Changes in 0.95-prerelease1:

* cavern: *fix with error values (one for same all round, two for horizontal
  and vertical, three for x, y, z)

* Fixed RISC OS not treating "foo." as a directory

* Improved behaviour when sgmltools not installed

* cavern: Merged patches for generating .3dx files for chasm

* Miscellaneous code tidying

* Moved unresolvable issues from BUGS to ZOMBIES

* cavern: Fixed articulation code bug (handling of some cases of components
  with multiple fixed points); added regression test

* cavern: "*begin" / "*end foo" now gives more explicit error

* cavern: More work on gross error detection

* xcaverot: you can now set environmental variables XCAVEROT_FONTNAME,
  XCAVEROT_INDICATOR_RADIUS

* extend: now starts from highest station with only one leg.  If no such
  station exists then revert to the previous behaviour of starting from
  the highest station (but complain if we have no legs at all).

* cavern: line numbers now correct for .svx files with Mac style lineends

* cavern: improved error reporting in several cases

* caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
  bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks

* cavern: added data styles "TOPOFIL" (like tape/compass/clino but with a
  counter instead of the tape), "CARTESIAN" (dx, dy, dz), and "NOSURVEY"
  (for unsurveyed connections between surveys)

* cavern: can now suppress "unused fixed point" error on a station by
  station basis by using: "*fix <station> reference <coords>"

* cavern: new command "*require <version>" to allow survey data to specify
  the minimum survex version required to process it

* print*: now search multiple print.ini files so you can override settings
  in the shipped file rather than having to modify it.  Search order is:
  ~/.survex/print.ini (unix only), $SURVEXHOME/myprint.ini,
  $SURVEXHOME/print.ini

* Changed xcaverot rotation/zoom to be the same way round as caverot

* diffpos, extend, xcaverot, caverot: Now use cmdline library to parse
  command line arguments and so support --help, --version, etc.

* hto2svx, svx2hto, and survex wrapper now all support --help and --version

* `configure --disable-aven' now disables building of aven

* caverot: on RISC OS fall back to using 2 or just 1 screen bank if there's
  not enough video memory allocated for 3.

* Documentation brought more up to date.

* If a station is only referenced once, and that reference is in a *equate
  and with an explicit prefix (e.g. "*equate 1 possibletypo.6"), a warning
  is issued.

Changes in 0.94-prerelease2:

* Added test for "cavern would segfault in articulate() on second *solve"
  (bug3.svx)

Changes in 0.94-prerelease1:

* cavern: Fix for bug reported by Leandro - cavern would segfault in
  articulate() on second *solve

* xcaverot: Applied patches from Leandro: fix menu buttons, keyboard
  shortcuts, colour of station markers, scalebar length and text display,
  mouse right-button "cave drag", centre-button "plan/elevation switch",
  zoom in/out menu button

* cavern: Fixed "matrix wouldn't invert" problem with certain datasets;
  added regression test (bug2)

* Check for sgmltools v3 (sgmltools-lite) as well as v2

* BorlandC and RISC OS config files are now regenerated when version number
  is updated

Changes in 0.93:

* Quick fix for problem with finding articulation points in particularly
  contorted components with 2 or more fixed points - for now each component
  is solved separately, but they aren't split at articulation points

* Turned off some debug code left active by mistake

* Test suite was missing a file

Changes in 0.92:

* 3dtodxf's DXF output can be opened by AutoCAD 13, 14 and 2000, as
  well as ArcView 3.x. Adobe Illustrator 8.0, and CorelDraw 8.
  [checked by Mike Yocum]

* HTML documentation now has meaningful filenames (no more "x532.htm")

* RISC OS documentation zip file now has correct filetype for
  Postscript version of docs

* RISC OS binary distribution now includes !CLIcon GUI front end

  operating system with sensible defaults in print.ini

* print.ini: major overhaul of layout to improve readability

* Another regression test case added

* HACKING: new file containing nuggets of wisdom for developers

* Added default s.d. for level legs

* Fixed network reduction bug (undoing network simplifications didn't
  always restore removed stations to the station list)

* Catch *begin with no matching *end

* Catch *begin and matching *end in different files

* Updated Portuguese, French, and German translations [Leandro/Eric/Gerhard]

* Wrong warning was being given for `*equate 1 1'

* xcaverot: fixed "step" button and keys

* caverot: reduced exe size down to slightly more than 0.91 (allegro issue)

Changes in 0.92-prerelease4:

* cavern: "*infer" wasn't working due to internal token value mismatch

* Short usage information now directs user to "--help"

* print.ini: Tidied up comments about font size and line width for
  printps

* printps: Line width now set correctly for all pages with ghostview

* cavern: Fixed problem with highly *equate-d nodes (introduced in
  0.92-pre1)

* aven: Fixed redraw errors; enabled splash screen [mark]

* cavern: Fixed deltastar network transformation to handle covariances

* More test cases added to catch any regressions of recent bug fixes

* Include alien.pl in distibution (helper script for compiling with
  BorlandC and on RISC OS)

* cavern: tests for zero now use epsilon related tests, apart for on
  RISC OS where the FP emulation appears to cut corners and give
  slightly incorrect answers.

* Now include Postscript version of documentation

* HTML documentation now uses ".htm" extension instead of ".html" to
  placate crap unzip programs which can't handle anything over 8.3

  autogenerated from the CVS commit messages

Changes in 0.92-prerelease3:

* xcaverot: Switching between plan and elevation now smoother

* xcaverot: Fixed poor handling of keypresses when rotating

* xcaverot: Reenabled buttons and made plan/elev button work properly

* aven: New experimental gtk-based xcaverot replacement

Changes in 0.92-prerelease2:

* Can now just run individual tests from test suite

* cavern: Turned off stray debugging output in matrix.c

* Improved various bits of debug code

* cavern: Fixed minor problems when compiling with NO_COVARIANCES

* In test suite, cavern failing now causes test to fail immediately

* Include riscos/config.h.in and borlandc/config.h.in in distribution

* cavern: Fixed bug when finding articulation points in a component
  with more than one fixed point

Changes in 0.92-prerelease1:

* caverot: Help screen incorrectly documented tilt as '/' and ':' -
  actually it's on '/' and ''' (single quote)

* caverot: Previously assumed shift-singlequote is '@' which is true
  on UK keyboards but not on US keyboards.  Quick fix: check both '@'
  and '"' for now.

* "printps -b" now reports "option requires an argument" (used to segfault)

* Updated printer driver command line options in manual

* caverot: Fixed shift key to accelerate movements in allegro version

* cavern: Disabled articulation point code (for now - there's a bug)

* cavern: If a datafile isn't found, now try a lowercase version
  before giving up (so on Unix you can now process a DOS dataset by
  unpacking with "unzip -L" to force filenames of unpacked files to
  lower case)

* diffpos: Fixed a couple of bugs; also now exits with status 1 if
  differences were reported

* Added some tests for cavern and diffpos - more to follow

* cavern: Covariance code now working and enabled by default

* cavern: When equating two existing stations we need to replace the
  pos of one with the pos of the other.  We used to look down the
  whole station list, now we just look at neighbouring nodes
  (noticable time saving for large networks with many equates)

* cavern: Renamed truncate function in commands.c to avoid clash with
  library truncate function on FreeBSD

* cavern: Warn that *prefix and *default are deprecated

* Fixed obscure problems when configure is rerun with a different prefix

* If the environmental variable SURVEXLANG isn't set, LANG is now
  check before resorting to the default.  LANG is a standard way to
  specify the language for GNU applications - SURVEXLANG is still
  useful as a way to specify an alternate language if Survex doesn't
  support your prefered language.

* Cured superfluous copy of svxdocs in doc/svxdocs in source distribution

* RISC OS and BorlandC builds now track copyright message and version
  number automatically

* If LANG is set to "en_US", treat it as if it were "en-us"

* xcaverot: Merged in changes from John Pybus and Mark Shinwell

* cavern: *solve followed by some entirely unconnected survey now
  caught cleanly (used to hit an assert)

* cavern: Corrected component and loop counts when there's hanging
  survey around

Changes in 0.91:

* Fixed problem with message files with accented characters

* Fixed RISC OS specific problem if SURVEXLANG was set

* xcaverot: Fixed to centre and scale cave on startup

* Removed superfluous containing directory for RISC OS documentation
