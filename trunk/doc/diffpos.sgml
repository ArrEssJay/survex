<Para>
Diffpos reports stations which
are in one file but not the other, and also stations which have moved
by more than a specified threshold distance in X, Y, or Z.  The
threshold distance is given in metres and defaults to 0.01m if not
specified.
</Para>

<Para>
For backward compatibility diffpos will also read the
&pos; files produced by earlier versions of cavern, or by 3dtopos.
