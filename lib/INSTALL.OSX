Installing Survex on MacOS X
============================

Next to the INSTALL file which you are currently reading is the
Survex Directory.  To install, just drag this directory to your
Applications folder.  You will need to be logged in at an
Administrator level to do this.

At present, you'll need to use the command line (via Terminal.app)
to process survey data.  Once it is processed, you can view it from
the desktop using Aven.
