Installing Survex under Unix
============================

Like so:

./configure
make
make install

By default `make install' will try to install survex under /usr/local, which
means you'll need to be root for the `make install' stage.  You can tell
configure to install survex elsewhere (e.g. under your home directory) like
so:

./configure --prefix=/home/olly/survex
make
make install
