Installing Survex under Unix
============================

If you are using Debian Linux or RedHat Linux or a distribution based
on one of these, you might prefer to install one of the prepackaged
Linux versions.

Otherwise building from source is very easy.  At a shell prompt, enter
the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

By default `make install' will try to install survex under /usr/local, which
means you'll need to be root for the `make install' stage.  You can tell
configure to install survex elsewhere (e.g. under your home directory) like
so:

./configure --prefix=/home/olly/survex
make
make install
