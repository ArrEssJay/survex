	* src/aventreectrl.cc: Fix to compile with wx >= 2.7.

Thu Jun 17 15:36:50 GMT 2010  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* src/img.c,src/img.h: Update to the version from 1.1.13 so that we
	  can read version 6 .3d files written by newer 1.1.x releases.
	* src/dump3d.c,src/extend.c,src/netskel.c: Set img_output_version to 3
	  before writing out a .3d file for compatibility with older 1.0.x
	  releases.  We don't use any of the newer features, so there's no
	  benefit to using a newer format version.

	* src/gfxcore.cc: Initialise m_MouseOutsideCompass and
	  m_MouseOutsideElev to avoid using them potentially uninitialised.

	* Backport change from branches/survex-1_1:
	* src/aboutdlg.cc: Add case for "GTK+ >= 2.6".

Wed Jun 16 14:14:11 GMT 2010  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Backport change to add support for WX_CONFIG as a
	  preferred new replacement for WXCONFIG.  Add wx2.8 and remove
	  wx2.5 (development version) from the list of wx versions to
	  check.
