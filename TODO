Survex ought to have a way of saying "Down" for diving legs too.

There is something that I would like (one more to the wish list?): to have the
*.err file sorted by error (the segment with the grossest error first).

One thing that would be extremely useful is a way to deal with the enormous
string of 'unused fixed point' errors you get from putting in a load of GPS
fixes. Some way of indicating that a particular fixed point is not intended
to be connected to the network is the most general solution. Then it wouldn't
be deemed a warning when it was found not to be connected. Or possibly
implement Immo's suggestion of nobbling a particular error message (not a
great solution - but still useful).

if there are errors, we shouldn't produce output files (reconsider some
errors as warnings if this is done though).

Point out in documentation that file structure and survey structure don't
have to be the same.  And in particular that folder/directory names can be
different.

A STYLE for 'connections' (with no TCC info) for feeding in surface data,
hydrological connections, etc.

Put 3dtodxf back in.  Or maybe wait until Leandro has brought it up-to-date.

Currently rpm isn't relocatable (since path to support files is compiled
in).  Can we fix this?

Check through warnings from RISC OS compile (in riscos.err)

Different print.ini for each platform - or some mechanism to specify?

Ideally want makefile to package DOS and RISC OS versions
