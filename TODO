?by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

click on station to centre; type in station to centre

label junctions/dead ends

colour by traverse

section colouring/selective labelling

clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

printout of current view...

shift-ed keys should move faster (as they do in caverot)

Middle button drag should "resist" at elevation (i.e. angle == 0)...

sort out wrap-around a highish zoom (caverot is OK)

colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"caverot --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

aven on monochrome displays - check depth colouring looks ok.

aven: redraw time should feed back to step size (so small caves on
fast puters look sane, and so autorotate keeps an even speed when
little can be seen for part of each rotation).

aven/caverot/xcaverot: if all points share a common prefix then
default to hiding it?

aven grid code -> printer drivers, caverot, and xcaverot too.
grid crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).
[(x,y) of a point to go through (easting, northing)
x spacing, y spacing (default to x spacing)
orientation (bearing of y-axis?) (defaults to 0)]

chase up zombies again?

resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

use "highest" title

Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

complain about *export-ing or *entrance-ing fictional stations

?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

doc/svxdocs.sgml has version number (0.98 currently) hardcoded.

flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg from one passage to another isn't surface,
but it isn't in the cave itself either (it's through rock).  You could
just call it surface but maybe later we want to use the surface
flag to produce a points for a surface triangulation...

Is this report wrong (2 nodes, 1 leg, and 2 1-nodes)

*fix 1 0 0 0
*fix 2 0 0 0
*equate 1 2

This is certainly wrong (2 legs, 1 1-node, and 1 2-node):

*fix 1 0 0 0 10
1 2 1 0 0
*fix 2 1 1 1

update translations

quotes in messages - translate too?

translate diffpos, etc

extract --help messages for translation.

check return values from fgets(), fread(), etc (done img.c and most
other places).

check skip blank pages works on printer drivers (notably printpcl)

prog --help and --version ought to work (perhaps both just do --version)
even if messages can't be found.

finish implementing covariances in a few places - grep for FIXCOV.

get Phil to fix where it says PHILU...

cylpolar style? Dr, Comp, Dz

back bearings?

one page HTML manual

win install lang??

glcaverot?

Rather than forming a linked list of components, solve each as it is
identified?

Don't split other traverses at articulating traverses when reporting error
stats.

*fix with datums etc

"*fix 1 0 0 0 1 1 1" gives:

Survey contains 1 survey station, joined by 0 legs.

There are 0 loops.

[...]

1 1-node.

I would expect "1 0-node."

Look into rounding of coords written to .3d files - e.g. tests/oneleg.svx.

From: Olly

test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

Tests these commands:
 FLAGS SD SET

deprecate *LRUD?

tests for direction - should direction work in non-interleaved data?

improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

print to an image file (use gd?)
