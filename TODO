xcaverot missing:, ^A (lazy redraw during drags), ^R (reverse sense of
controls), escape vs q...

check xcaverot/caverot/aven have consistent senses to mouse and keyboard
controls; shift-ed keys in xcaverot should move faster...

switch_to_(plan|elevation) in xcaverot should animate.

caverot: by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached

caverot: click on station to centre; type in station to centre

caverot: improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

try using labels.c in xcaverot to see if XRegions are better or not?

label junction/fixed points/...

colour by traverse

section colouring/selective labelling

aven: surface vs underground data...

extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

caverot help page needs fettling so that it appears centrally (and indeed
so that it all fits on the screen in chunky CGA modes) [BC fns to look at:
textheight("W"), textwidth(), settextstyle()]

caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation
points?

If you have an auto-update scheme for the webpages when you do a release,
then get it update this template and mail it to lsm@execpc.com (with
the subject 'add' (even for updates)) would ensure things were kept up
to date.

Covariance matrices are symmetric, so we only need to store 6 of the 9
entries (but intermediate matrices need the full 9 since the product
of 2 symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric).

grid patch -> printer drivers, caverot, aven, and xcaverot too; grid
crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).
[(x,y) of a point to go through (easting, northing)
 x spacing, y spacing (default to x spacing)
 orientation (bearing of y-axis?) (defaults to 0)]

cavern: auto declination? NEW_STYLE?

update translations

chase up zombies again?

resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

use "highest" title?

Warn bearings not 3 digits, gradient not <sign><digit><digit>

Allow angles as deg/min/sec (for theodolite data) (060°10'15" as 060 10 15,
or 060.1005 (crap notation))

Add support for bearings of form N20E (ie [NS][0-9]+[EW])

should % after a clino reading work?

add to UNITS: percentage, lengthoutput, angleoutput ?

error and warning log for survex?

Fixing a point by triangulation?

Theodolite + level:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  delta(vertical) / maybe "clino" instead

Theodolite only:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  infinite sd for z

Infinite sds so we can fix in x and y only (or z only)?

add *data to hto to allow it to cope with different data ordering?

use more accuracy than nearest point (1/72") in printps?

funcs to spot differences between caves:
  display two plots at once, maybe flash in ram banks?
  compare nets

make printps & printhpgl one program; make printdm and printpcl one
program - autosense (by looking at argv[0]) which we're being run as
(and use symbolic link in Unix). Provide command line option as
override (so we can use alias/batchfile for DOS)?

get DOS programs to abort on Ctrl-C reliably?

Sort out code fragments to attempt to handle dud equates (nodes equated
to each other but not referred to otherwise (done?)

Warning: Survey not all connected (but all attached to fixed points)?

Label lengths aren't considered when working out image size in prindept.c,
so a long label can spill off the edge of the printout

"error.c" add option to read errors from disc only when needed, to help
when memory is tight

printer driver name spills over one page on Wookey's printer (printdm)

improve messages given when a signal is received (eg more precise
reporting of 'Arithmetic error' as 'Divide by zero', 'Negative root', etc)

Tests these commands:
 DATA FIX (with sds) FLAGS INFER LRUD (deprecated) SD SET SOLVE (1 test) TITLE

? Allow F(orward)/B(ack) in data - checked somehow (?)

? Use machine epsilon for comparing floating point numbers

? This survey gives wrong node stats: (2 nodes, 0 legs and 2 *1*-nodes)
  *fix 1 0 0 0
  *fix 2 0 0 0
  *equate 1 2

Specify prefix level explicitly here:
en: 26 Station `%s' must be exported in a higher level
en: 27 Station `%s' not exported from lowest prefix level

szlig new orthography...

flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg isn't surface, but it isn't in the cave
itself either.  You could just call it surface though...
