allow disabling of specific warnings - e.g. loads of 'unused fixed point'
errors you get from putting in a load of GPS fixes.  Or way to indicate
a particular fixed point is not necessarily intended to be used.

If there are errors, we shouldn't produce output files (reconsider some
errors as warnings if this is done though).

Point out in documentation that file structure and survey structure don't
have to be the same.  And in particular that folder/directory names can be
different.

Currently rpm isn't relocatable (since path to support files is compiled
in).  Can we fix this?  Does anyone care?

Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation points.

RISC OS caverot should probably fall back to using 2 or even just one screen

[lsm entry]
If you have an auto-update scheme for the webpages when you do a release,
then get it update this template and mail it to lsm@execpc.com (with
the subject 'add' (even for updates)) would ensure things were kept up
to date.

If you do 'make install' it replaces your print.ini with the new
default one, which is a pain in the bum (loses your selected printer,
and new defintions you might have made, etc). Can we make it do
something smarter please?  [Probably best to have second file for
customisations - also checking "~/.survex/print.ini" might be useful
while we're at it]

Covariance matrices are symmetric, so we only need to store 6 of the 9
entries (but intermediate matrices need the full 9 since the product
of 2 symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric).

svx092pre5 [...] did produce an error file much longer than whatever
version I ran before.  [Previous version deleted so unable to discover
what it was.]
