[Document xcaverot keys somewhere]
pan view - cursor keys
start autorotate - return
stop autorotate - space
toggle labels - ^N
toggle crosses - ^X
restore default view - delete
exit - q
eLevation - l
Plan - p
z/x - slower/faster rotation
[/] - zoom out/in
r - reverse direction of autorotation
c/v - rotate one step
'// - higher/lower viewpoint
n/s/e/w/u/d - view cave from north/south/east/west/above/below
O (overlapping labels)

xcaverot missing:, ^A (lazy redraw during drags), ^R (reverse sense of
controls), escape vs q...

check xcaverot/caverot/aven have consistent senses to mouse and keyboard
controls; shift-ed keys in xcaverot should move faster...

switch_to_(plan|elevation) in xcaverot should animate.

caverot: by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached

caverot: click on station to centre; type in station to centre

caverot: improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

try using labels.c in xcaverot to see if XRegions are better or not?

label junction/fixed points/...

colour by traverse

section colouring/selective labelling

aven: surface vs underground data...

extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

caverot help page needs fettling so that it appears centrally (and indeed
so that it all fits on the screen in chunky CGA modes) [BC fns to look at:
textheight("W"), textwidth(), settextstyle()]

caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation points.

[lsm entry]
If you have an auto-update scheme for the webpages when you do a release,
then get it update this template and mail it to lsm@execpc.com (with
the subject 'add' (even for updates)) would ensure things were kept up
to date.

Covariance matrices are symmetric, so we only need to store 6 of the 9
entries (but intermediate matrices need the full 9 since the product
of 2 symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric).

grid patch -> printer drivers, caverot, aven, and xcaverot too; grid
crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).
[(x,y) of a point to go through (easting, northing)
 x spacing, y spacing (default to x spacing)
 orientation (bearing of y-axis?) (defaults to 0)]

Subject: documentation

Update documentation (2 volunteers are currently working on this).

Document *require, *export, *flags, plumbed diving legs,
easting/northing/altitude vs dx/dy/dz (waiting until changes to docs come
back to avoid trying to patch a modified version...)

Point out in documentation that file structure and survey structure don't
have to be the same.  And in particular that folder/directory names can be
different.

duncs comment on rewording docs on where files are looked for:
 If an included file does not have a complete path, cavern will look
 for it starting from the directory of the file which includes it.
to:
 This isn't (or at least should be) the case.  *include should resolve
 relative to the directory which the parent file is in (just as
 relative HTML links do).
and:
 Cavern will try adding a ".svx" extension if no extension is present,
 and will also try translating "\" to "/" (or other appropriate tricks
 on RISC OS).  And as a last resort, it will try a lower case version
 of the filename (so if someone sends you a DOS/Windows dataset with
 mismatched case, unzip with "unzip -L" and unix cavern should process it).

add ms windows installer info to docs:

===
A survex group is created in the start menu containing
 Aven
 Survex Help
 Uninstall Survex

Icons are installed for svx and 3d files. right click on svx gives 
open->notepad {default}
process->cavern

right click on 3d
open->aven {default}
extend->extend /* Is this working properly at the moment? Aven seems to get *
                * very confused with the output from it...                  */
print->printwin

cavern: auto declination? NEW_STYLE?

update translations

chase up zombies

resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

use "highest" title?

Warn bearings not 3 digits, gradient not <sign><digit><digit>

Allow angles as deg/min/sec (for theodolite data) (060°10'15" as 060 10 15,
or 060.1005 (crap notation))

Add support for bearings of form N20E (ie [NS][0-9]+[EW])

should % after a clino reading work?

add to UNITS: percentage, lengthoutput, angleoutput ?

error and warning log for survex?

Fixing a point by triangulation?

Theodolite + level:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  delta(vertical) / maybe "clino" instead

Theodolite only:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  infinite sd for z

Infinite sds so we can fix in x and y only (or z only)?

Radiolocation?

add *data to hto to allow it to cope with different data ordering?

use more accuracy than nearest point (1/72") in printps?

funcs to spot differences between caves:
  display two plots at once, maybe flash in ram banks?
  compare nets

make printps & printhpgl one program; make printdm and printpcl one
program - autosense (by looking at argv[0]) which we're being run as
(and use symbolic link in Unix). Provide command line option as
override (so we can use alias/batchfile for DOS)?

get DOS programs to abort on Ctrl-C reliably?

Split network at articulation points (ref: DSA page 245)?

Sort out code fragments to attempt to handle dud equates (nodes equated
to each other but not referred to otherwise (done?)

Warning: Survey not all connected (but all attached to fixed points)?

Label lengths aren't considered when working out image size in prindept.c,
so a long label can spill off the edge of the printout

"error.c" add option to read errors from disc only when needed, to help
when memory is tight

printer driver name spills over one page on Wookey's printer (printdm)

improve messages given when a signal is received (eg more precise
reporting of 'Arithmetic error' as 'Divide by zero', 'Negative root', etc)

Tests these commands:
 CASE DATA DEFAULT (deprecated) FIX (with sds) FLAGS INFER
 LRUD PREFIX (deprecated) SD SET SOLVE (one test) TITLE TRUNCATE

? Allow F(orward)/B(ack) in data - checked somehow (?)

? Use machine epsilon for comparing floating point numbers

? This survey gives wrong node stats: (2 nodes, 0 legs and 2 *1*-nodes)
  *fix 1 0 0 0
  *fix 2 0 0 0
  *equate 1 2
