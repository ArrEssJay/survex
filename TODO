Survex ought to have a way of saying "Down" for diving legs too.

There is something that I would like (one more to the wish list?): to have the
*.err file sorted by error (the segment with the grossest error first).

One thing that would be extremely useful is a way to deal with the enormous
string of 'unused fixed point' errors you get from putting in a load of GPS
fixes. Some way of indicating that a particular fixed point is not intended
to be connected to the network is the most general solution. Then it wouldn't
be deemed a warning when it was found not to be connected. Or possibly
implement Immo's suggestion of nobbling a particular error message (not a
great solution - but still useful).
