[Document xcaverot keys somewhere]
pan view - cursor keys
start autorotate - return
stop autorotate - space
toggle labels - ^N
toggle crosses - ^X
restore default view - delete
exit - q
eLevation - l
Plan - p
z/x - slower/faster rotation
[/] - zoom out/in
r - reverse direction of autorotation
c/v - rotate one step
'// - higher/lower viewpoint
n/s/e/w/u/d - view cave from north/south/east/west/above/below
O (overlapping labels)

xcaverot missing:, ^A (lazy redraw during drags) ^L
(no legs), ^R (reverse sense of controls), escape vs q...

check xcaverot/caverot/aven have consistent senses to mouse and keyboard
controls; shift-ed keys in xcaverot should move faster...

switch_to_(plan|elevation) in xcaverot should animate.

caverot: by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached

caverot: click on station to centre; type in station to centre

caverot: improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

try using labels.c in xcaverot to see if XRegions are better or not?

caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation points.

If you have an auto-update scheme for the webpages when you do a release,
then get it update this template and mail it to lsm@execpc.com (with
the subject 'add' (even for updates)) would ensure things were kept up
to date.

Covariance matrices are symmetric, so we only need to store 6 of the 9
entries (but intermediate matrices need the full 9 since the product
of 2 symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric).

Subject: documentation

Update documentation (2 volunteers are currently working on this).

Document *require, *export, *flags, plumbed diving legs,
easting/northing/altitude vs dx/dy/dz (waiting until changes to docs come
back to avoid trying to patch a modified version...)

Point out in documentation that file structure and survey structure don't
have to be the same.  And in particular that folder/directory names can be
different.

duncs comment on rewording docs on where files are looked for...

Sort out INSTALL.DOS and mingw_extras/INSTALL.txt
