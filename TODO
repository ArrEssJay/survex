Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow

If you have an auto-update scheme for the webpages when you do a release,
then get it update this template and mail it to lsm@execpc.com (with
the subject 'add' (even for updates)) would ensure things were kept up
to date.

Covariance matrices are symmetric, so we only need to store 6 of the 9
entries (but intermediate matrices need the full 9 since the product
of 2 symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric).

grid patch -> printer drivers, caverot, aven, and xcaverot too; grid
crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).

cavern: auto declination? NEW_STYLE?

update translations

chase up zombies again?

resolve entries in TODO; resolve FIXMEs in code

test diving data with compass omitted (plumbed)

use "highest" title

Warn bearings not 3 digits, gradient not <sign><digit><digit>

Allow angles as deg/min/sec (for theodolite data) (060°10'15" as 060 10 15,
or 060.1005 (crap notation))

Add support for bearings of form N20E (ie [NS][0-9]+[EW])

should % after a clino reading work?

add to UNITS: percentage, lengthoutput, angleoutput ?

error and warning log for survex?

Fixing a point by triangulation?

Theodolite + level:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  delta(vertical) / maybe "clino" instead

Theodolite only:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  infinite sd for z

Infinite sds so we can fix in x and y only (or z only)?

add *data to hto to allow it to cope with different data ordering?

use more accuracy than nearest point (1/72") in printps?

funcs to spot differences between caves:
  display two plots at once, maybe flash in ram banks?
  compare nets

? make printps & printhpgl one program; make printdm and printpcl one
program - autosense (by looking at argv[0]) which we're being run as
(and use symbolic link in Unix). Provide command line option as
override (so we can use alias/batchfile for DOS)?

get DOS programs to abort on Ctrl-C reliably?

Sort out code fragments to attempt to handle dud equates (nodes equated
to each other but not referred to otherwise (done?)

Label lengths aren't considered when working out image size in prindept.c,
so a long label can spill off the edge of the printout

"message.c" add option to read errors from disc only when needed, to help
when memory is tight

printer driver name spills over one page on Wookey's printer (printdm)

? improve messages given when a signal is received (eg more precise
reporting of 'Arithmetic error' as 'Divide by zero', 'Negative root', etc)

Tests these commands:
 DATA FIX (with sds) FLAGS INFER LRUD (deprecated) SD SET TITLE

? Allow F(orward)/B(ack) in data - checked somehow (?)

? Use machine epsilon for comparing floating point numbers

? This survey gives wrong node stats: (2 nodes, 0 legs and 2 *1*-nodes)
  *fix 1 0 0 0
  *fix 2 0 0 0
  *equate 1 2

If there are errors, existing .pos and .inf files aren't removed, but
existing .3d and .err files are...

Default variance for topofil counter? (currently same as that of tape)

For warnings such as "Suspicious compass reading", report the reading
in question in the error message (in the text form given in the file).
Also report values when warning about problems with processed readings.

complain about exporting fictional stations

?outlaw prefixes on stations in data legs (as Todd has lobbied for)
and then the prefix of a leg == prefix of each end...?

'Writing out 3d image file all.3d'... - but may get deleted if errors...

?by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

click on station to centre; type in station to centre

improve 3d torture test and try to automate its use if possible.

label junction/fixed points/...

colour by traverse

section colouring/selective labelling

clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

printout of current view...

shift-ed keys should move faster (as they do in caverot)

Middle button drag should "resist" at elevation (i.e. angle == 0)...

Check consistent senses to mouse and keyboard controls:
          caverot/xcaverot/aven
but1L/R:     ?     dragbot dragtop (wook thinks drag top)
c          ?cwise?  cwise  acwise (wook thinks acwise)

reverse controls should reverse mouse and keyboard

sort out wrap-around a highish zoom (caverot is OK)

colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"caverot --prefix \161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

centre on only legs???

Track down bug Brian reported in DJGPP version...

extract help screen from caverot.c for translation

caverot help page needs fettling so that it appears centrally (and indeed
so that it all fits on the screen in chunky CGA modes) [BC fns to look at:
textheight("W"), textwidth(), settextstyle()]

caverot: on RISC OS now fall back to using 2 or even just one screen
bank if we can't find a mode where we can create 3 banks [FIXME: need
to test this works]

Check that --mode-picker works on DJGPP caverot.

Check SIGINT on DOS caverot restores text mode...

flag legs as "skeletal" or something? (i.e. not in the cave passage) -
e.g. a radiolocation leg isn't surface, but it isn't in the cave
itself either.  You could just call it surface though...

station flags: fixed point / "important" - e.g. top camp "fixed" point
/ ? surface/underground (a station can be both) (inferable from legs)
/ entrance (implied by surface/ug join, but better to specify as caves
with no surf svy and also situations in which multiple surveys leave
an entrance) / exported

junction,deadend (inferable from order) / articulation pt (know for
nodes I think a station is if at least one of its nodes is)

legs: surface/duplicate/splay (done)

legs: implied: inloop/plumb/nosurvey, diving, other styles

legs: "dubious" for "tapeless" legs - bearing along continuation...

legs: hydrology - fossil/active/not recorded/static water/underwater
(sump) [diving uderw by default? except style can mean altimeter
too...]

legs: floor type - mud/sand/breakdown/flowstone/etc and can then used
LRUD to draw crude survey...

legs: "commented out" flag?  syntax check data but otherwise ignore
