wxaven:

- clino needs resistance around 0

- scale bar dragging factor needs slight tweak

- finish reverse controls

- possible mysterious problem with [ and ] not zooming to screen centre

- get warning box if wxWindows doesn't have translation into requested language

- segfaults trying to load 3dtorture/onestn.3d

wxaven problems with unknown solution:

- continuing trouble with accelerator keys

- Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed... [from Mark: libgtk1.2 1.2.10-1 exhibits these symptoms]

- releasing drag over menubar doesn't send event properly...

wxaven for Windows:

- Close button in About box not in correct place

wxaven for GTK:

- trouble with zooming in too far
