Another remark: Did you know that you can crash CAVEROT by setting the
scale factor to very large or very small values (probably larger/smaller
than MIN/MAXFLOAT)?! This would be worth an error catch....
[Seems to be fixed by newer allegro version, let me know if you still get
problems - Olly]

On a PC Card:
[In DJGPP+Allegro caverot] the help screen flashes up and then
disappears - this is probably our problem, not yours (the VESA 2 support being
relatively new) :-)

In DJGPP+Allegro caverot: On an NT 4 server, the mouse works in the
mode-picker, but not in caverot itself.  Also, the mode caverot tries to
select by default doesn't work, although caverot seems blissfully unaware of
the fact - detect NT and default to a mode that is more likely to work (VGA?)

I noticed from the code that it does look for an 'u' or 'd' or 'q'
keypress and these work in the program as expected from the code. I
didn't know this as xcaverot -help etc didn't tell me what keys are
currently looked at.

I still get that random memory error [from cavern.exe, 0.90 alpha5, win95]
(Wookey is unable to reproduce this - Peter thinks it might be dodgy
hardware).

[Running caverot] my screen "freezes" with no image, and I'm forced to
restart the computer to get the screen back. [win95, 0.90 alpha (5 or
earlier)]
(Maybe an allegro problem - I've upgraded to allegro 3.1 to see if that
cures the problem).  PWJ suggests the graphics card might be the problem.

When I use caverot if I set the language to another one different than
english, the screen doesn't print well the words with accents.

Using survex v0.91 printps (on redhat 5.1 with HPJL-II printer -actually
an EPl-4300) I find that the first page of any printout has extremely
fine lines (only just visible). All subsequent pages have properly-sized
lines which vary according to the line-width setting in the print.ini
file, and are very nice.

On redhat 5.1 with HPJL-II printer -actually an EPl-4300 [...] if I
use the [...] printpcl driver I get the old 'horizontal-tab' problem,
as previously reported even though the setting not to use it is still
there - I do not understand what is going on, but it may have more to
do with interactions with the lpr dystem than survex itself....
