wxaven:
- elevation indicator

wxaven problems with unknown solution:
- continuing trouble with accelerator keys
- Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed... [from Mark: libgtk1.2 1.2.10-1 exhibits these symptoms]

wxaven for Windows:
- doesn't run (crash on startup)

wxaven with Motif:
- need to resize window to get any display at all
- about box is resizable
- flicker on window resize
