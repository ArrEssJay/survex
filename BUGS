In DJGPP+Allegro caverot: On an NT 4 server, the mouse works in the
mode-picker, but not in caverot itself.  Also, the mode caverot tries to
select by default doesn't work, although caverot seems blissfully unaware of
the fact - detect NT and default to a mode that is more likely to work (VGA?)

I noticed from the code that it does look for an 'u' or 'd' or 'q'
keypress and these work in the program as expected from the code. I
didn't know this as xcaverot -help etc didn't tell me what keys are
currently looked at.

On RISC OS: `cavern --output=3Ddir.' results in files such as
`3Ddir./3d' being created.
[Olly: I think fDirectory() isn't spotting `3Ddir.' as a directory -
workaround is to use `3Ddir' instead which does work]
[2000-07-24 Olly: Believed fixed, needs testing]
