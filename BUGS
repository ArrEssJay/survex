wxaven:
- get it to build on/for win32
- check it with wxMotif
- confusion over semantics of "reverse controls"
- configure script needs to allow specification of toolkit (GTK/Motif)
- some code needs a bit of a tidy
- continuing trouble with accelerator keys
- internationalisation needs doing
- tiny change required to code locating about box png file
