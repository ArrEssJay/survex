Another remark: Did you know that you can crash CAVEROT by setting the
scale factor to very large or very small values (probably larger/smaller
than MIN/MAXFLOAT)?! This would be worth an error catch....

Use of "!" to turn a command line option off is annoying on Unix (it does
event look up in some shells if not escaped) and is rather non-standard -
think of a better approach.

On a PC Card:
[In DJGPP+Allegro caverot] the help screen flashes up and then
disappears - this is probably our problem, not yours (the VESA 2 support being
relatively new) :-)

In DJGPP+Allegro caverot: On an NT 4 server, the mouse works in the
mode-picker, but not in caverot itself.  Also, the mode caverot tries to
select by default doesn't work, although caverot seems blissfully unaware of
the fact.

I noticed from the code that it does look for an 'u' or 'd' or 'q'
keypress and these work in the program as expected from the code. I
didn't know this as xcaverot -help etc didn't tell me what keys are
currently looked at.
