wxaven:
- about box layout needs attention
- Close button in about box doesn't work
- get it to build on/for win32
- confusion over semantics of "reverse controls"
- configure script needs to allow specification of toolkit
- some code needs a bit of a tidy
- occasional random crashes on startup (suspected wxWindows problem)
- continuing trouble with accelerator keys
- internationalisation needs doing
- tiny change required to code locating about box png file
- toggling status bar on requires window resize for correct operation
