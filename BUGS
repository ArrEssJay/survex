I noticed from the code that it does look for an 'u' or 'd' or 'q'
keypress and these work in the program as expected from the code. I
didn't know this as xcaverot -help etc didn't tell me what keys are
currently looked at.

[Unix Aven known bugs]

closing window doesn't work

slow response of toolbar highlighting during constant rotation
(XFree86 v4 fixes this)

not all Xcaverot keys implemented 

heading indicator not working -- soon to be fixed

On RISC OS: `cavern --output=3Ddir.' results in files such as
`3Ddir./3d' being created.
[Olly: I think fDirectory() isn't spotting `3Ddir.' as a directory -
workaround is to use `3Ddir' instead which does work]

[2001-01-25 Olly: wasn't fixed, but should be now - needs testing again]

`*include 193' reported oddly:

In file included from surface/2000/root.svx:16,
                      surf.svx:31,
		      all.svx:13:
cavern: Couldn't open data file '193'

This would be better:

In file included from surf.svx:31,
		      all.svx:13:
surface/2000/root.svx:16: Couldn't open data file '193'
