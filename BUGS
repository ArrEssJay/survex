Another remark: Did you know that you can crash CAVEROT by setting the
scale factor to very large or very small values (probably larger/smaller
than MIN/MAXFLOAT)?! This would be worth an error catch....

Use of "!" to turn a command line option off is annoying on Unix (it does
event look up in some shells if not escaped) and is rather non-standard -
think of a better approach.
