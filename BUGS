wxaven:
- clino needs resistance around 0
- need to prevent zooming in/out silly amounts (e.g. when scale bar is 1cm)
- scale bar dragging factor needs slight tweak
- finish reverse controls
- possible mysterious problem with [ and ] not zooming to screen centre
- get warning box if wxWindows doesn't have translation into requested language

wxaven problems with unknown solution:
- continuing trouble with accelerator keys
- Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed... [from Mark: libgtk1.2 1.2.10-1 exhibits these symptoms]
- releasing drag over menubar doesn't send event properly...

wxaven for Windows:
- Close button in About box not in correct place

wxaven for GTK:
- trouble with zooming in too far
