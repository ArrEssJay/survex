- dragging scale bar should change scale, not move scale bar!

- status bar?

- "Alt-F, Ctrl-Z" changes hotkey for File->Open from Ctrl-O to Ctrl-Z !?!

- Accents in compass and clinometer labels don't display right - need
to fix font encoding. [quick fix is to use wxROMAN in place of wxSWISS]

- Accents in menus were working but suddenly stopped - I think this
happened when I upgraded debian and a new libgtk package got
installed...

- Problems with which way the indicators point...
