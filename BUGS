Bugs in wxaven:

leaving "about" box causes a segfault

some shortcuts are missing (space/return/arrowkeys/'/slash/[/]/delete)

doesn't load files from command line

toggle status bar does nothing

ought to have ticks on menu items in view menu

N/S/E/W should select views

window close doesn't work

sometimes stops responding
