survex (1.0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fix printing which was deciding how many pages to spread the plot
    over by looking at the whole paper size, not the printable area.
  * aven: When exporting, omit surface data if it's not being shown at the
    moment.  Also omit unnecessary MOVE ops from generated files (which saves
    quite a lot of space when surface data is turned off).
  * Set Aven's icon on non-Windows platforms too.  This means that with
    windowmaker the appicon has an icon without user intervention, and
    probably improves things with other windowmanagers too.
  * extend: Added documentation and test cases for the new extend features.
  * manual: Fix example of setting decimal separator.
  * Include syntax colouring mode for .svx files for the vim editor, written
    by David Loeffler.

survex (1.0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * extend: Added changes from John Pybus which allow you to specify a
    configuration file to control how the centreline is extended - e.g.
    where to fold and where to break loops.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 22 Jan 2005 01:44:39 +0000

survex (1.0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed bug which would sometimes pick one too few pages
    vertically resulting in the survey escaping off the top of the topmost
    pages.
  * aven: Changed the toner-wasting, hard-to-measure-exactly alternately filled
    scale bar to a simple line with ticks.
  * aven: SVG export fixes: second and subsequent exports had bogus extra
    "</g>"; Fixed to invert all Y coordinates, not just some; Fixed tags for
    layers.
  * aven: Added EPS export option.
  * Minor documentation updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Wed, 13 Jan 2005 05:40:38 +0000

survex (1.0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed font sizes in "Print Preview".
  * aven: In the print setup dialog, replaced "Orientation" radio buttons with
    "Plan" and "Elevation" buttons.
  * aven: Fixed info box on printouts of elevations, tilted views, and
    extend elevations.
  * aven: Added "fit on one page" option, and make it the default.
  * aven: Reorder "Cancel", "Preview", "Print" buttons and make "Print" the
    default button.
  * aven: Read settings back from the print dialog when the "Print" button is
    pressed (was only done for "Preview" previously).
  * aven: Sorted out the initial size of the "Print Preview" window.
  * aven: Fixed the window manager's close button on the "Print Preview"
    window - previously this was being ignored.
  * aven: Sorted out initial survey scaling when loading a survey at startup.
  * aven: Fixed the measuring line to work better when the survey tree is
    manipulated with keys.  Tweaked redrawing of the measuring line to be a
    smidgen more efficient.  Fixed the blob and ring size which were one
    pixel too small on Windows.
  * aven: Added "System Information:" section to the "About" dialog to hold
    information useful when reporting bugs.  Currently it contains the
    wxWindows version, OS version, and colour depth information.
  * aven: Changed the "About" dialog's "Close" button to be "OK" for
    consistency with pretty much every other application.
  * aven: Added "File->Export as..." which integrates cad3d's functionality
    within aven.
  * aven: Updated a few icons.
  * cad3d: Added SVG export support from John Pybus
  * Fixed to allow compilation with GCC 3.4
  * Updates to German translation.

  * cavern: Equates are no longer considered when deciding which stations are
    flagged as surface and underground.
  * Romanian translation mostly completed.
  * Minor packaging tweaks (added website URL and changed package descriptions
    to start with a lowercase letter as suggested by packaging guidelines).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 29 May 2004 23:01:13 +0100

survex (1.0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * cad3d: Fixed problem with DXF files which stopped them loading with some
    drawing packages (introduced in 1.0.27).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 19 Mar 2004 14:55:23 +0000

survex (1.0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed 3d file reading code to fix incorrect unpacking of compressed
    station names in a rare case.  Also checked other rare cases work
    correctly.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 08 Mar 2004 20:54:03 +0000

survex (1.0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * cad3d: DXF output now puts surface legs, stations, and labels in separate
    layers.
  * debian/control,debian/rules: The default gcc/g++ is now c102 so removed
    code to explicitly use GCC 3.2.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Wed, 07 Jan 2004 03:27:58 +0000

survex (1.0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Fixed lintian warning.
  * Tidied up debian/rules.
  * cavern: Fixed interleaved topofil data style - the length was always being
    calculated as zero.
  * aven: "All Files" now shows files without extensions too.
  * aven: added Ctrl+Q as shortcut for File->Exit.
  * aven: depth colouring now uses a proper colour gradient.
  * cad3d: fixed -e and -r options to not crash (the long versions have always
    worked).
  * extend: fixed to initialise an internal structure - failing to do so was
    probably causing crashes on some platforms.
  * Fixed standard graphics for "Note", "Warning", etc in the PostScript manual.
  * Documentation updated.
  * fixed svxedit man page which previously contained xcaverot documentation!
  * test suite: check that cavern doesn't report "nan" or "NaN" for any values.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 29 Nov 2003 00:40:24 +0000

survex (1.0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated config.guess and config.sub (closes: bug#186687).
  * Added missing Build-Depends on xlibs-dev (closes: bug#186956).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 31 Mar 2003 17:49:29 +0100

survex (1.0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: fixed LEVEL (broken since around 1.0.8) and added test case.
  * cavern: corrected handling of declination in Compass DAT files and added
    test case; also added tests for other aspects of Compass DAT file
    reading.
  * printps/printpcl: fixed blank page detection in some obscure cases.
  * Documentation: started manual section on working with Compass data files.
  * Added Build-Depends on gcc-3.2 and g++-3.2.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 28 Mar 2003 02:03:16 +0000

survex (1.0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation: include 3d v3 file format description on MS Windows, MS
    DOS, and RISC OS too; include PNG graphics for manual on MS Windows; minor
    updates to manual.
  * Prefer wxWindows 2.4 if it's available (closes: bug#183158).
  * Disabled experimental support for Chinese (LANG=zh) - it isn't currently
    working and makes the printer drivers unusable when LANG is set to zh.
  * Changed Section from math to science.
  * Changed Priority from optional to extra (we clearly should be optional).
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.8.0 (support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 04 Mar 2003 20:54:17 +0000

survex (1.0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed handling of extended elevations (and other flat surveys).
  * Documentation: fixed 3d v3 file format description and include it in debs.
  * Build-Depends on libwxgtk2.3-dev|libwxgtk2.2-dev so we still build on
    hppa while Ron Lee resolves the wx hppa build failure.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 26 Nov 2002 04:22:26 +0000

survex (1.0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: when reading Compass DAT files, we now processes compass and clino
    backsights, and recognise the "X" flag which indicates a leg should be
    entirely ignored.  And we now report correct line number with errors in
    Compass .MAK files.
  * cavern: if "*infer plumbs on", don't infer a plumb if the clino is
    +/- 90 degrees, but the backclino isn't (and vice versa).
  * cavern: fixed 3dx output so it actually works with Chasm once more.
  * cavern: don't allocate extra space needed for producing 3dx output for
    Chasm unless we're actually producing that output - saves about 8 bytes
    per station.
  * cavern: removed slightly too keen sanity check which could misfire in very
    unusual circumstances.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 16 Nov 2002 15:15:12 +0000

survex (1.0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: update display when "Metric" or "Degrees" is toggled.
  * cavern: fixed handling of compass and clino corrections in Compass survey
    data - these were interpreted as radians rather than degrees so the
    correction was about 57 times too large!)
  * Improved handling of Compass PLT files - if the survey name is empty, don't
    insert a survey separator character.
  * Documentation: fixed incorrect markup which resulted in a bogus footnote.
  * Use wxwindows-2.3 rather than wxwindows-2.2 (closes: bug#166105).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 01 Nov 2002 15:28:37 +0000

survex (1.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: can now process Compass format survey data, and even mixed
    datasets.
  * cavern: major speedup (up to 60%) when reading in survey data containing
    a lot of stations in the same survey hierarchy level (which is how Compass
    files are handled).
  * cavern: don't warn about a compass reading on a plumbed leg if the
    plumb was inferred and the compass reading is zero.
  * cavern: reduced memory usage in code which reads a survey station name.
  * cavern: reported CPU time would go negative if cavern ran for more than
    about 36 minutes (highly unlikely but not impossible on a slow machine
    with a large, highly interconnect survey) - fixed.
  * cavern: avoid unnecessary work when --percentage isn't specified.
  * cavern: Writing "*:" at the start of a .svx file would crash cavern - fixed
    and added test case.  This is an error anyway, but it shouldn't cause a
    crash.
  * Don't distribute unused toolbar icons.
  * Documentation: minor updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 25 Oct 2002 03:16:34 +0100

survex (1.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed "Process" action on .svx files.
  * File associations: if survex-svxedit isn't installed, run gnome-edit
    instead.
  * Include file associations and file icons in the main package rather than
    survex-aven.
  * Documentation: added details of the 3d file format (version 3).
  * Updated TODO list.
  * Tweaked source to hopefully build on HPPA again (closes: bug#162912).
  * Proper description for survex-svxedit (closes: bug#162954, bug#162970).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 07 Oct 2002 00:29:05 +0100

survex (1.0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: 1.0.15 and 1.0.16 addressed MS Windows specific problems.
  * survex-aven package now installs mime types, icons, and file associations
    for Gnome.  Note: at present GMC doesn't seem to notice new files being
    created (e.g.  Process on a .svx file creates .3d and .err files) - you
    have to manually refresh the view.
  * survex-svxedit is now architecture independent.  Fixed up a few lintian
    warnings relating to it too.
  * Minor update to manual.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 24 Sep 2002 20:20:20 +0100

survex (1.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * svxedit: This is a Survex data entry editor from the therion team.  It
    currently experimental needs tcl and wish installed, so is it its own
    package: survex-svxedit.
  * Improved handling of Compass PLT files and CMAP xyz files.
  * aven: when picking non-overlapping labels, show a slight preference to
    shorter labels with the aim of displaying more labels.
  * aven: fixed hard to notice problem which could cause the cave to appear
    tilted sideways after a lot of manipulation.
  * cavern: Modest speed improvement (0.5% for sample dataset).
  * cavern: fixed a rarely sighted bug which caused erroneous error about some
    stations not being attached to a fixed point.
  * cavern: fixed clino readings and DIRECTION to work in interleaved data.
  * cavern: improved error reporting when an invalid value is given for a
    DIRECTION reading.
  * cavern: fixed "singular matrix" error when very low SDs were specified.
  * print*: if the --raw is used, the survey can now use the space this would
    have taken up.
  * Reading of ASCII 3d files now copes with MSDOS/MS Windows line endings
    once again.  Added regression test for this.
  * Updated documentation.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sun, 15 Sep 2002 00:11:05 +0100

survex (1.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed bug which caused the occasional spurious leg to be shown
    connecting arbitrary stations.
  * extend: try to extend along a survey, and make breaks where other surveys
    join.
  * cavern: Number reading code reworked to allow repeat readings to be
    supported, but the actual repeat reading code is currently disabled,
    and everything should work exactly as before.
  * Experimental support for Chinese (LANG=zh) - only a few messages are
    currently translated.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 28 Jun 2002 15:34:26 +0100

survex (1.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * sorterr: fixed to work with more than 1024 traverses.
  * Fixed handling of iso-8859-2 character set.
  * Fixed Aven to work from Debian Apps menu (running an installed program
    with an explicit path works again).
  * xcaverot: automatically switch on PDA mode if the screen is narrower than
    640 pixels.
  * Updates to Portuguese translation - all translations are now up-to-date.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 07 Jun 2002 18:16:30 +0100

survex (1.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: improvements in 1.0.10 to the file type selector only work with
    wxGtk >= 2.3 (the debian package is the latest stable release: 2.2.9
    where this doesn't work).  Fixed to work as well as possible on 2.2.9,
    and as intended if rebuilt against 2.3.
  * aven: fixed so that loading PLT files works regardless of the current locale
    (previously it would fail for locales where the decimal character wasn't
    '.').
  * aven: key actions during autorotation no longer temporarily pause
    autorotation.
  * aven: switching to plan or elevation while rotating is now smooth.
  * aven: removed undocumented and confusing "free rotation mode".
  * cad3d: write dummy passage dimensions to .plt files to avoid Compass bug.
  * printps: now supports coloured printouts.
  * print*: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * extend: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * Updates to Italian translation.
  * Minor documentation updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Wed, 29 May 2002 13:44:31 +0100

survex (1.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fully disabled some debug code (closes: bug#147309).
  * aven: only add a file to the list of recently used files if it was opened
    successfully.
  * aven: recognise ".plf" as a Compass PLT file too; recognise uppercase
    variants of file extensions in File->Open filters to help people who
    transfer files from MSDOS/MS Windows.
  * cavern: fixed bogus warning triggered by "*begin abc.def" (I'm not sure
    that this should be valid, but the warning given wasn't appropriate).
  * Fixed scaling problem when reading PLT file (feet->metres conversion
    factor was being applied backwards!)
  * Fixed potential problem when reading or writing a 3d file which couldn't
    be opened.
  * Translate dots to spaces in survey names in Compass PLT files.
  * Better handling of PLT files which have a D command before any M command.
  * Updates to German and Italian internationalisations.

survex (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * img_open_survey() could crash if you tried to open an unrecognised file
    (i.e. not .3d, .pos, .plt, or .xyz format).
  * North and East were the wrong way round when reading in .plt files.
  * cad3d: Improved .plt file output - Compass should read it now.
  * Documentation updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 05 Apr 2002 01:52:54 +0100

survex (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * printdm and printpcl now obey font_size_labels setting in print.ini etc.
  * Enhancements and bug-fix to handling of Topofil.
  * *FIX with 3 standard deviations but no covariances now works.

    files - should be good enough for reading into Carto.
  * img library now reads Compass .plt files as if they were .3d files.
  * Updated ca and es internationalisations.

    fails on this source we now retry with -O instead of -O2.  Hopefully
    this'll get us a build on all architectures...
