survex (1.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Clicking on a survey name in the survey tree now highlights it in
    the map view.  Double-clicking zooms the view to show the clicked survey
    highlighted.  Clicking the root clears the highlighting and double-clicking
    the root restores the default view.  To expand/collapse a branch, click
    on the "[+]" or "[-]" icon to the left of the survey name.
  * aven: The measuring line can now measure to anywhere in plan or elevation
    view (not just to a station!)  In plan view the horizontal distance and
    bearing are shown, while in elevation view the vertical distance is shown.
  * aven: Moving the mouse over a station in the survey view now highlights
    that station in the survey tree (though it may not be visible if the
    survey(s) it is in aren't expanded).
  * aven: Clicking on a station to centre the view now moves the mouse pointer
    to the new location of the station (except on Mac OS X where this isn't
    allowed).
  * aven: Fix which presentation toolbar buttons are shown as depressed.
  * Fix infinite loop reading 3d files with LRUD data (bug introduced in
    1.1.9).
  * vim files are now installed with the correct paths (bug introduced in
    1.1.9).

survex (1.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix img to filter out cross-sections which don't match the subsurvey (if
    specified).  The API now returns img_XSECT_END to mark the end of a
    passage rather than setting a flag on the last img_XSECT of the passage.
  * Enhance integration with the vim editor - this can now colour .err files,
    run cavern from vim and parse error output, and run aven from vim.  Tweak
    the existing vim mode for .svx files to fix a few minor bugs and add
    support for the new "*data passage" style.
  * aven: fix drawing of the "blob" end of the measuring line on graphics
    cards which can't draw large enough blobs for us.
  * aven: sort out confusion about what encoding everything is in which means
    that the distance measured by the measuring line actually gets displayed
    and also fixes problems with empty menu items in non-English locales in
    some cases.
  * aven: redraw grey background after a menu is closed over the aven window
    with no survey loaded.
  * aven: fix bug which caused printing to crash (introduced in 1.1.8).
  * aven: avoid crash on some machines when opening "About" dialog before having
    loaded a survey.
  * aven: Translate "Plan" and "Elevation" buttons in print view dialog.
  * aven: Fix character set handling of cavern output.
  * cavern: Report an error if a cross-section is specified for a station which
    doesn't exist.
  * Updated French and Italian translations.
  * aven: Fix "Can't open message file `en_US' using path
    `${prefix}/share/survex'" error.
  * Fix bug in 3d file reading on 64 bit platforms when used in STANDALONE mode
    (doesn't affect Survex itself, but other applications which use img.c should
    update their copy).

survex (1.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer a debian native package.
  * Updated "Build-Depends:" for the new X library packaging.
  * Incorporate rebuilt debian/rules from 1.0 branch.
  * "Standards-Version: 3.7.2" - no changes required.
  * Add desktop file for aven contributed to the Ubuntu package by Phil Bull.
  * debian/doc-base: Register the manual in Apps/Science rather than Apps/Math
    for consistency with where we put the Debian menu entry.
  * Add Conflicts/Replaces with survex-aven package.
  * Restore survex-svxedit package.
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop support for building with wxWidgets versions prior to 2.4.0
      (which was released on 2003-01-07).
    + aven: Printing through aven now uses settings from the "[aven]" section
      of print.ini, and support for hierarchical sections (using "like=") has
      been disabled.
    + aven: Change mouse actions to be compatible with those in Survex 1.0.
      The mousewheel now zooms in/out (it doesn't do anything in 1.0) and
      left drag is now smart about not rotating and zooming at the same
      time.
    + aven: Highlighting stations now happens as you type, and pressing
      "Enter" or clicking the "Find" button now pans and zooms to show the
      highlighted stations.
    + aven: Left-clicking away from a station now cancels measuring line.
    + aven: Setting view to North, South, East, or West is now animated like
      the tilt from plan to elevation.
    + aven: Fix presentation saving to also write "." for decimal points and
      presentation loading to accept either "." or ",".
    + aven: Add text for all toolbar items so that aven will work with the
      Gnome desktop preference for displaying toolbars as icons with text or
      just text (wxWidgets needs fixing first though).
    + aven: Remove the ability to detach the menu bar (yell if you actually
      used it and I'll restore it!)
    + aven: Add "all survey files" option to the "open file" dialog.
    + aven: Disable "Highlight exported points" if there aren't any.
    + Updates to French translation from Michel Bovey.  Also updates to German,
      Italian, Catalan, Spanish, and Romanian translations.
    + test suite: fix smoke test to pass even without X running (it was meant
      to but the code had a bug).
    + aven: Check if OpenGL is available and exit cleanly with a helpful error
      if it isn't.
    + aven: Fix --help and --version to work without a working X display
      (provided it's built with wxWidgets 2.5.1 or newer which the debian
      package sadly isn't currently).
    + aven: Automatically select the presentation tab of the notebook when the
      user selects "New Presentation" or "Open Presentation".
    + aven: Fix "Delete" in the presentation list to not get passed on (and so
      not reset to default view as well).
    + aven: Fix Ctrl+Insert in the presentation list not to segfault if the
      list is empty.
    + aven: Fix Cursor Up and Down in the presentation list to move the
      highlight up and down instead of being passed on and moving the survey.
    + aven: Improve SVG output compatibility.  Tested with Mozilla Firefox 1.5,
      Adobe's SVG browser plugin, Gimp 2.2.8, Gqview 2.0.0, Opera 8.5,
      Safari 2.0.3, and InkScape 0.42.
    + aven: Put a 5mm border around exported SVG files to allow for station
      markers and non-zero width lines.
    + aven: Fix crash when exporting as SVG or Sketch if labels or surface data
      was turned on.
    + aven: Actually close the file we're exporting which fixes problems with
      it not always being fully written.

survex (1.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: Add validity checking for dates in *date commands (with feature
    test in testsuite).  A date entered as just "year" or "year.month" now
    becomes a date range for the relevant period (previously it became a single
    date near the middle of that period).
  * extend: Fixed 2 uninitialised flags (problem apparently never manifests
    on Linux - presumably we're lucky and always get zeroed memory from malloc
    if we never call free).
  * extend: Default output name for a file called input.3d is now
    input_extend.3d rather than just extend.3d (which was annoying if you
    wanted to extend several surveys in the same directory).
  * aven: OpenGL 2.0 always includes support for point sprites so rework
    our for them to include that knowledge.
  * aven: Regenerate depth bar if user switches to/from metric units.
  * aven: Don't clear the "there" mark just because the mouse pointer has
    moved off a station.
  * aven: When processing a .svx file, put the resultant .3d file in the
    same directory (since that's where we then try to load it from).
  * aven: Fix labelling of date colouring on 32 bit platforms.
  * aven: If "colour by date" is on and we load a survey with no date info
    (or all surveyed on the same date) then set "colour by none".
  * aven: Make the error dialog modal and remove a signal handler once it
    has fired to prevent endless (or seemingly endless) cascades of error
    dialogs.
  * aven: Enforce a minimum object volume diameter of 1m to avoid problems
    if a survey file with only one station in is loaded.
  * aven: Fix problems with indicators disappearing when we're drawing
    blobs and/or crosses the slow (but always supported) way.  (Problem
    introduced in 1.1.6).
  * aven: Really stop setting extra toolbar margin when using GTK2.0.  The
    attempt to fix this in 1.1.3 failed because __WXGTK12__ is set for GTK+
    1.2 or *any later release* so is true for GTK+ 2.0 too!
  * aven: Add details of which of wxGTK, wxMotif, and wxX11 we've been
    compiled with, and which GTK+/Motif version where appropriate.
  * documentation: Updates to 3d file format specification from Mike McCombe.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 18 Oct 2005 03:19:42 +0100

survex (1.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: If aven is asked to load a .svx, .dat, or .mak file, run cavern on
    it, showing cavern's output in a window (with errors and warnings clickable
    to load the offending file into an editor), and then loading the resulting
    3d file.
  * aven: Added "Colour by Date" option.
  * aven: Disable "Colour by Depth" option if there's no elevation variation.
  * aven: Don't crash if trying to load a survey with no elevation variation.
    Instead turn off depth colouring.
  * aven: Export as HPGL added.
  * aven: Improved update of mouse coordinates and measuring line (thanks to
    Martin Green).
  * aven: Show the coordinates of either the mouse pointer or the nearest
    survey station to it (if there is one near enough).  Showing both was
    confusing and meant the status bar overflowed on smaller displays.
  * aven: When printing an extended elevation, don't show bearing and elevation.
  * aven: Don't lock "flat" surveys which aren't extended elevations - a
    flat survey with LRUD data isn't flat any more!
  * aven: When we have to draw blobs and crosses the slow way (because the
    graphics hardware doesn't support the fast way), draw them so that they
    should appear at the correct depth into the 3D scene instead of on top
    of everything else.
  * aven: Make "play presentation backwards" icon green to match the other
    presentation icons.
  * cavern: Store dates for img_XSECT.
  * cavern: Fixed small one-off memory leak if you specify -o more than once.
  * Check environmental variable LC_MESSAGES when deciding what language to use
    for messages.
  * Removed old printer drivers.
  * img library: When creating a 3d file, ignore img_XSECT if we've been asked
    to write a file format version which doesn't support it.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 10 Oct 2005 05:09:19 +0100

survex (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Make blobs round like they are in Survex 1.0.
  * aven: If the graphics drivers don't support drawing blobs using OpenGL
    point markers, fall back to drawing filled circles.
  * aven: If the graphics drivers support it, draw crosses as texture mapped
    OpenGL point markers which is much faster.
  * aven: Cross size increased to match Survex 1.0.
  * aven: We must update which blobs are displayed if display of surface or
    underground legs is toggled.
  * cavern: Fix handling of a *solve followed by survey data, none of which is
    attached to the previous data.
  * cavern: Fixed "No survey data" error when a *solve is followed by another
    *solve (or the implicit solve at the end of processing) with no data between
    them.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 20 Sep 2005 15:08:53 +0100

survex (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Added Aven's icon to the "About" dialog.
  * aven: Use localised character for the decimal point (e.g. "," in most
    continental European countries).
  * aven: Previously the survey tree would get focus and then take keypresses
    (e.g. "P", "L", "Delete").  Now we pass most keypresses across so they
    operate on the cave, and transfer the input focus across when we do.
  * aven: Make pressing "Return" in the tree control expand/collapse a
    subtree.
  * aven: Speed up intialisation by delaying creation of OpenGL lists until
    they're needed.
  * aven: Added Mark Shinwell's bounding box with shadow of the survey.
  * aven: Disable the "Tubes" button/menu item when there's no LRUD data.
  * aven: Reworded "Restore Default Settings" as "Restore Default View".
  * aven: Set sensible default margins for printing and preserve any margin
    values the user specifies between runs (previously margins defaulted to 0
    each time aven was run).
  * Documentation: Document *DATA PASSAGE in the manual.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 17 Sep 2005 21:34:57 +0100

survex (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: Allow OMIT character (-) for left/right/up/down.
  * aven: Remove an unnecessary menu separator.
  * aven: Fix "Find" and "Hide" toolbar buttons to work with GTK2.0.
  * aven: Make the tooltip for "Hide" show the number of found stations.
  * aven: If * or ? is used in a glob-style pattern, force a non-substring
    match.
  * aven: Enable "New Presentation" when there's a 3d file loaded, rather than
    when there's a presentation loaded.
  * aven: Make entrances green in side panel tree list to match green blobs used
    in cave view.
  * aven: Don't show surface labels if we're not showing surface data, etc.
  * aven: Merge "Start Rotation" and "Stop Rotation" into "Toggle Rotation" and
    make "Space" the key for this.  Keep Return working "Stop Rotation" so
    existing users are happy, but don't advertise it.
  * aven: Normalise filename by adding any extension used, and use the
    normalised filename for file history and window title.
  * aven: Stop setting extra toolbar margin when using GTK2.0 as the toolbar
    buttons already have a sensible margin - the extra margin is only needed
    with GTK1.2.
  * aven: Fix handling of plumb legs in tube model.
  * aven: Fixed swapped L and R in tube model.
  * extend: Preserve UD cross-section information in extended elevation.
  * extend: Add new messages for John Pybus' enhancements.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Wed, 07 Sep 2005 00:33:01 +0100

survex (1.1.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added support for LRUD data in .svx files, in .3d files, and aven can
    now load and display it on screen and on printouts.  The ability to "fake"
    LRUD data in aven is gone for now but will reappear in some form later.
  * cavern: Removed support for writing Chasm's 3dx format.  We're going to
    fold any desirable missing chasm functionality into aven.
  * aven: Rearranged mouse actions as discussed on the mailing list.  Added
    cursors for each different mouse action to help the user learn what each
    does.  Also added cursors for the "compass" and "clino" as well as the
    scalebar to suggest to the user that they can be dragged to change the view.
  * aven: Don't segfault on Unix if LANG isn't a known language.
  * tests/smoketest.tst: If X windows is running, check that we can run aven
    with --help and --version.
  * tests/cavern.tst: Fixed cavern.tst to warn if it is skipping a test because
    no results are listed for it.  This revealed that there was a "newline" test
    which should have been called "newline", and was a broken testcase too!
    Fixed all these problems.
  * cavern: Applied Simeon Warner's patch for handling backcompass, backclino,
    and omitted forward compass/clino readings in Compass DAT files.  Added
    a feature test for this to the testsuite.
  * It no longer makes sense to have an option not to build aven or to build
    aven without OpenGL so remove old machinery for this from configure and
    the sources.
  * configure: Check if "-lXxf86vm" is needed on UNIX.
  * configure: Better output for strcasecmp test.
  * aven: Fix crosses to work much better.  Not a total fix - their position
    in the Z buffer isn't correct and they're rather slow to plot.
  * aven: Don't regenerate the hittest grid every time the mouse moves while
    animating, which solves the mysterious pausing effect (thanks go to Martin
    Green for spotting this!)  Also clear all the status bar coordinates when
    animating.
  * aven: Sort out clashing menu shortcuts in some languages.
  * aven: Fixed compilation problem on x86_64
  * SPUD: Pruned out stuff which has been done or which is not actually relevant
    to this branch.
  * Merge various changes from 1.0 branch:
    + aven: Port over "printing from aven" functionality.
    + aven: Port over "export as" functionality,
    + Add David Loeffler's vim mode for .svx files.
  * aven: Fix check for whether a label is behind us in perspective view.
  * aven: Don't use an opengl list for drawing the indicators - we typically
    make a new list each time we plot them anyway.
  * Remove lingering traces of support for RISC OS and pre-386 MSDOS
  * aven: Set icon on non-Windows platforms too.  This means that with
    WindowMaker on UNIX you get an icon on the AppIcon by default.
  * configure: Update wxWindows checks to handle newer wx versions.
  * Make all maintainer perl scripts "use bytes;" to avoid utf-8 double
    encoding problems.  They also all require Perl 5.8 now (hopefully this
    isn't an issue for anyone building from CVS).
  * acinclude.m4: Quote macro name for fix autotools warning.
  * doc/aven.sgml: "tilt up" is "'" not ",".
  * aven: Add support for mousewheels (to tilt the cave).
  * aven: Fixed twisted transitions to and from pitches in certain cases.
  * aven: Pick a sensible initial window size when the user's desktop is
    spread over more than one monitor (works best with wx2.5 or newer, but try
    to do better with wx2.4 or earlier as well).
  * aven: Initialise GfxCore slightly later to avoid visual glitch from notebook
    contents being visible before any survey is loaded.
  * aven: Allow a coloured texture to be used
  * aven: Don't initialise until we have data (to the user, this means the
    window is default colour (grey for most systems) not black until a survey
    is loaded).
  * aven: Fixed weird "shadowed" icons.

survex (1.1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * aven: Now uses OpenGL for 3d rendering.
  * aven: Solid passages - passage dimensions are currently inferred from
    the leg length (pretty effective as you can measure longer legs in
    larger passages).  Use of real LRUD data coming soon...
  * aven: Depth colouring is now continuously varying.
  * aven: Colour by depth can now be turned off (and there's the start of a
    framework for properly implementing colour by date, error, etc).
  * aven: Find stations moved onto the toolbar and now uses a simple wildcarded
    match (? matches any character, * matches any number of characters).
  * aven: We now use the status bar for coordinates, distances, etc to make
    better use of screen space.
  * aven: Full screen mode (F11).
  * aven: Perspective view.
  * aven: Context sensitive cursor shape - needs more work.
  * aven: Mouse actions changed (hopefully they're now more natural, but
    you may find the change disorientating - feedback wanted on this).
  * aven: Added "presentations" which allow you to set up fly-through paths
    and load/save/run them.
  * aven: A presentation can be exported as a movie file.
  * aven: Added Save screenshot facility.
  * aven: Depth fogging option.
  * aven: Added Smooth Lines option.
  * aven: Added Textured Walls option.
  * aven: If a survey has surface legs but no underground legs, default to
    showing the surface legs.
  * cavern: Dates given to *date are now stored in the 3d file.

  * aven: Fixed font sizes in "Print Preview".
  * aven: In the print setup dialog, replaced "Orientation" radio buttons with
    "Plan" and "Elevation" buttons.
  * aven: Fixed info box on printouts of elevations, tilted views, and
    extend elevations.
  * aven: Added "fit on one page" option, and make it the default.
  * aven: Reorder "Cancel", "Preview", "Print" buttons and make "Print" the
    default button.
  * aven: Read settings back from the print dialog when the "Print" button is
    pressed (was only done for "Preview" previously).
  * aven: Sorted out the initial size of the "Print Preview" window.
  * aven: Fixed the window manager's close button on the "Print Preview"
    window - previously this was being ignored.
  * aven: Sorted out initial survey scaling when loading a survey at startup.
  * aven: Fixed the measuring line to work better when the survey tree is
    manipulated with keys.  Tweaked redrawing of the measuring line to be a
    smidgen more efficient.  Fixed the blob and ring size which were one
    pixel too small on Windows.
  * aven: Added "System Information:" section to the "About" dialog to hold
    information useful when reporting bugs.  Currently it contains the
    wxWindows version, OS version, and colour depth information.
  * aven: Changed the "About" dialog's "Close" button to be "OK" for
    consistency with pretty much every other application.
  * aven: Added "File->Export as..." which integrates cad3d's functionality
    within aven.
  * aven: Updated a few icons.
  * cad3d: Added SVG export support from John Pybus
  * Fixed to allow compilation with GCC 3.4
  * Updates to German translation.

  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Fixed lintian warning.

  * Added Build-Depends on gcc-3.2 and g++-3.2.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 28 Mar 2003 02:03:16 +0000

survex (1.0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation: include 3d v3 file format description on MS Windows, MS
    DOS, and RISC OS too; include PNG graphics for manual on MS Windows; minor
    updates to manual.
  * Prefer wxWindows 2.4 if it's available (closes: bug#183158).
  * Disabled experimental support for Chinese (LANG=zh) - it isn't currently
    working and makes the printer drivers unusable when LANG is set to zh.
  * Changed Section from math to science.
  * Changed Priority from optional to extra (we clearly should be optional).
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.8.0 (support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 04 Mar 2003 20:54:17 +0000

survex (1.0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed handling of extended elevations (and other flat surveys).
  * Documentation: fixed 3d v3 file format description and include it in debs.
  * Build-Depends on libwxgtk2.3-dev|libwxgtk2.2-dev so we still build on
    hppa while Ron Lee resolves the wx hppa build failure.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 26 Nov 2002 04:22:26 +0000

survex (1.0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: when reading Compass DAT files, we now processes compass and clino
    backsights, and recognise the "X" flag which indicates a leg should be
    entirely ignored.  And we now report correct line number with errors in
    Compass .MAK files.
  * cavern: if "*infer plumbs on", don't infer a plumb if the clino is
    +/- 90 degrees, but the backclino isn't (and vice versa).
  * cavern: fixed 3dx output so it actually works with Chasm once more.
  * cavern: don't allocate extra space needed for producing 3dx output for
    Chasm unless we're actually producing that output - saves about 8 bytes
    per station.
  * cavern: removed slightly too keen sanity check which could misfire in very
    unusual circumstances.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sat, 16 Nov 2002 15:15:12 +0000

survex (1.0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: update display when "Metric" or "Degrees" is toggled.
  * cavern: fixed handling of compass and clino corrections in Compass survey
    data - these were interpreted as radians rather than degrees so the
    correction was about 57 times too large!)
  * Improved handling of Compass PLT files - if the survey name is empty, don't
    insert a survey separator character.
  * Documentation: fixed incorrect markup which resulted in a bogus footnote.
  * Use wxwindows-2.3 rather than wxwindows-2.2 (closes: bug#166105).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 01 Nov 2002 15:28:37 +0000

survex (1.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * cavern: can now process Compass format survey data, and even mixed
    datasets.
  * cavern: major speedup (up to 60%) when reading in survey data containing
    a lot of stations in the same survey hierarchy level (which is how Compass
    files are handled).
  * cavern: don't warn about a compass reading on a plumbed leg if the
    plumb was inferred and the compass reading is zero.
  * cavern: reduced memory usage in code which reads a survey station name.
  * cavern: reported CPU time would go negative if cavern ran for more than
    about 36 minutes (highly unlikely but not impossible on a slow machine
    with a large, highly interconnect survey) - fixed.
  * cavern: avoid unnecessary work when --percentage isn't specified.
  * cavern: Writing "*:" at the start of a .svx file would crash cavern - fixed
    and added test case.  This is an error anyway, but it shouldn't cause a
    crash.
  * Don't distribute unused toolbar icons.
  * Documentation: minor updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 25 Oct 2002 03:16:34 +0100

survex (1.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed "Process" action on .svx files.
  * File associations: if survex-svxedit isn't installed, run gnome-edit
    instead.
  * Include file associations and file icons in the main package rather than
    survex-aven.
  * Documentation: added details of the 3d file format (version 3).
  * Updated TODO list.
  * Tweaked source to hopefully build on HPPA again (closes: bug#162912).
  * Proper description for survex-svxedit (closes: bug#162954, bug#162970).

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Mon, 07 Oct 2002 00:29:05 +0100

survex (1.0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: 1.0.15 and 1.0.16 addressed MS Windows specific problems.
  * survex-aven package now installs mime types, icons, and file associations
    for Gnome.  Note: at present GMC doesn't seem to notice new files being
    created (e.g.  Process on a .svx file creates .3d and .err files) - you
    have to manually refresh the view.
  * survex-svxedit is now architecture independent.  Fixed up a few lintian
    warnings relating to it too.
  * Minor update to manual.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Tue, 24 Sep 2002 20:20:20 +0100

survex (1.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * svxedit: This is a Survex data entry editor from the therion team.  It
    currently experimental needs tcl and wish installed, so is it its own
    package: survex-svxedit.
  * Improved handling of Compass PLT files and CMAP xyz files.
  * aven: when picking non-overlapping labels, show a slight preference to
    shorter labels with the aim of displaying more labels.
  * aven: fixed hard to notice problem which could cause the cave to appear
    tilted sideways after a lot of manipulation.
  * cavern: Modest speed improvement (0.5% for sample dataset).
  * cavern: fixed a rarely sighted bug which caused erroneous error about some
    stations not being attached to a fixed point.
  * cavern: fixed clino readings and DIRECTION to work in interleaved data.
  * cavern: improved error reporting when an invalid value is given for a
    DIRECTION reading.
  * cavern: fixed "singular matrix" error when very low SDs were specified.
  * print*: if the --raw is used, the survey can now use the space this would
    have taken up.
  * Reading of ASCII 3d files now copes with MSDOS/MS Windows line endings
    once again.  Added regression test for this.
  * Updated documentation.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Sun, 15 Sep 2002 00:11:05 +0100

survex (1.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed bug which caused the occasional spurious leg to be shown
    connecting arbitrary stations.
  * extend: try to extend along a survey, and make breaks where other surveys
    join.
  * cavern: Number reading code reworked to allow repeat readings to be
    supported, but the actual repeat reading code is currently disabled,
    and everything should work exactly as before.
  * Experimental support for Chinese (LANG=zh) - only a few messages are
    currently translated.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 28 Jun 2002 15:34:26 +0100

survex (1.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * diffpos: fixed to work on 64bit architectures.
  * sorterr: fixed to work with more than 1024 traverses.
  * Fixed handling of iso-8859-2 character set.
  * Fixed Aven to work from Debian Apps menu (running an installed program
    with an explicit path works again).
  * xcaverot: automatically switch on PDA mode if the screen is narrower than
    640 pixels.
  * Updates to Portuguese translation - all translations are now up-to-date.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 07 Jun 2002 18:16:30 +0100

survex (1.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: improvements in 1.0.10 to the file type selector only work with
    wxGtk >= 2.3 (the debian package is the latest stable release: 2.2.9
    where this doesn't work).  Fixed to work as well as possible on 2.2.9,
    and as intended if rebuilt against 2.3.
  * aven: fixed so that loading PLT files works regardless of the current locale
    (previously it would fail for locales where the decimal character wasn't
    '.').
  * aven: key actions during autorotation no longer temporarily pause
    autorotation.
  * aven: switching to plan or elevation while rotating is now smooth.
  * aven: removed undocumented and confusing "free rotation mode".
  * cad3d: write dummy passage dimensions to .plt files to avoid Compass bug.
  * printps: now supports coloured printouts.
  * print*: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * extend: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * Updates to Italian translation.
  * Minor documentation updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Wed, 29 May 2002 13:44:31 +0100

survex (1.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fully disabled some debug code (closes: bug#147309).
  * aven: only add a file to the list of recently used files if it was opened
    successfully.
  * aven: recognise ".plf" as a Compass PLT file too; recognise uppercase
    variants of file extensions in File->Open filters to help people who
    transfer files from MSDOS/MS Windows.
  * cavern: fixed bogus warning triggered by "*begin abc.def" (I'm not sure
    that this should be valid, but the warning given wasn't appropriate).
  * Fixed scaling problem when reading PLT file (feet->metres conversion
    factor was being applied backwards!)
  * Fixed potential problem when reading or writing a 3d file which couldn't
    be opened.
  * Translate dots to spaces in survey names in Compass PLT files.
  * Better handling of PLT files which have a D command before any M command.
  * Updates to German and Italian internationalisations.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 24 May 2002 12:48:54 +0100

survex (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * img_open_survey() could crash if you tried to open an unrecognised file
    (i.e. not .3d, .pos, .plt, or .xyz format).
  * North and East were the wrong way round when reading in .plt files.
  * cad3d: Improved .plt file output - Compass should read it now.
  * Documentation updates.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 05 Apr 2002 01:52:54 +0100

survex (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * print*: --no-borders fixed to work as documented; --no-cutlines added to
    turn off the dashed lines where pages join on multi-page printouts.

  * printdm and printpcl now obey font_size_labels setting in print.ini etc.
  * Enhancements and bug-fix to handling of Topofil.
  * *FIX with 3 standard deviations but no covariances now works.
  * cad3d: new --plt option produces crude approximation to Compass .plt
    files - should be good enough for reading into Carto.
  * img library now reads Compass .plt files as if they were .3d files.
  * Updated ca and es internationalisations.

survex (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiling gfxcore.cc often causes an ICE in GCC 2.95, so if the compile
    fails on this source we now retry with -O instead of -O2.  Hopefully
    this'll get us a build on all architectures...
