survex (1.0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: 1.0.15 and 1.0.16 addressed MS Windows specific problems.
  * survex-aven package now installs mime types, icons, and file associations
    for Gnome.  Note: at present GMC doesn't seem to notice new files being
    created (e.g.  Process on a .svx file creates .3d and .err files) - you
    have to manually refresh the view.
  * survex-svxedit is now architecture independent.  Fixed up a few lintian
    warnings relating to it too.
  * Minor update to manual.

survex (1.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * svxedit: This is a Survex data entry editor from the therion team.  It
    currently experimental needs tcl and wish installed, so is it its own
    package: survex-svxedit.
  * Improved handling of Compass PLT files and CMAP xyz files.
  * aven: when picking non-overlapping labels, show a slight preference to
    shorter labels with the aim of displaying more labels.
  * aven: fixed hard to notice problem which could cause the cave to appear
    tilted sideways after a lot of manipulation.
  * cavern: Modest speed improvement (0.5% for sample dataset).
  * cavern: fixed a rarely sighted bug which caused erroneous error about some
    stations not being attached to a fixed point.
  * cavern: fixed clino readings and DIRECTION to work in interleaved data.
  * cavern: improved error reporting when an invalid value is given for a
    DIRECTION reading.
  * cavern: fixed "singular matrix" error when very low SDs were specified.
  * print*: if the --raw is used, the survey can now use the space this would
    have taken up.
  * Reading of ASCII 3d files now copes with MSDOS/MS Windows line endings
    once again.  Added regression test for this.
  * Updated documentation.

survex (1.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fixed bug which caused the occasional spurious leg to be shown
    connecting arbitrary stations.
  * extend: try to extend along a survey, and make breaks where other surveys
    join.
  * cavern: Number reading code reworked to allow repeat readings to be
    supported, but the actual repeat reading code is currently disabled,
    and everything should work exactly as before.
  * Experimental support for Chinese (LANG=zh) - only a few messages are
    currently translated.

survex (1.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * diffpos: fixed to work on 64bit architectures.
  * sorterr: fixed to work with more than 1024 traverses.
  * Fixed handling of iso-8859-2 character set.
  * Fixed Aven to work from Debian Apps menu (running an installed program
    with an explicit path works again).
  * xcaverot: automatically switch on PDA mode if the screen is narrower than
    640 pixels.
  * Updates to Portuguese translation - all translations are now up-to-date.

 -- Wookey <wookey@survex.com>  Fri, 07 Jun 2002 18:16:30 +0100

survex (1.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: improvements in 1.0.10 to the file type selector only work with
    wxGtk >= 2.3 (the debian package is the latest stable release: 2.2.9
    where this doesn't work).  Fixed to work as well as possible on 2.2.9,
    and as intended if rebuilt against 2.3.
  * aven: fixed so that loading PLT files works regardless of the current locale
    (previously it would fail for locales where the decimal character wasn't
    '.').
  * aven: key actions during autorotation no longer temporarily pause
    autorotation.
  * aven: switching to plan or elevation while rotating is now smooth.
  * aven: removed undocumented and confusing "free rotation mode".
  * cad3d: write dummy passage dimensions to .plt files to avoid Compass bug.
  * printps: now supports coloured printouts.
  * print*: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * extend: fixed to work correctly with PLT files.
  * Updates to Italian translation.
  * Minor documentation updates.

survex (1.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * aven: Fully disabled some debug code (closes: bug#147309).
  * aven: only add a file to the list of recently used files if it was opened
    successfully.
  * aven: recognise ".plf" as a Compass PLT file too; recognise uppercase
    variants of file extensions in File->Open filters to help people who
    transfer files from MSDOS/MS Windows.
  * cavern: fixed bogus warning triggered by "*begin abc.def" (I'm not sure
    that this should be valid, but the warning given wasn't appropriate).
  * Fixed scaling problem when reading PLT file (feet->metres conversion
    factor was being applied backwards!)
  * Fixed potential problem when reading or writing a 3d file which couldn't
    be opened.
  * Translate dots to spaces in survey names in Compass PLT files.
  * Better handling of PLT files which have a D command before any M command.
  * Updates to German and Italian internationalisations.

  * Enhancements and bug-fix to handling of Topofil.
  * *FIX with 3 standard deviations but no covariances now works.

survex (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiling gfxcore.cc often causes an ICE in GCC 2.95, so if the compile
    fails on this source we now retry with -O instead of -O2.  Hopefully
    this'll get us a build on all architectures...
