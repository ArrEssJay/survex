FIXME: This is all rather incomplete.  I really must sort it out.

Thanks to Mark Fearon, Bill Purvis, and Andy Waddinton for spotting and
solving minor problems in previous releases, and to Bill Purvis, Devon
Bowen, and John Pybus for their work on xcaverot.  Iain Miller also deserves
a mention for letting us play with his very interconnected survey data from
OFD.  Andy Holtsbery kindly fixed a few problems with xcaverot due to
changes in other files.

Martin Heller, John Halleck, Sean Kelly, Patrick Warren, and Leandro Dybal
Bertoni also deserve a mention.

Also a big thankyou to CUCC for a great deal of testing in Austria over the
past few years.

Thanks to the following people for their work on the translations:

French: Eric Madelaine/Francois Dani
German: Gerhard Niklasch/Jens Rasch
Portuguese: Leandro Dybal Bertoni
Catalan and Spanish: Josep Guarro
Italian: Roberto Maugeri (Zoom)

Also, a big thanks to everyone who has reported bugs and problems, and
suggested improvements.

More people: Mark Shinwell, Phil Underwood, Gavin Lowe, Thilo Mueller,
Ray Duffy, Julian Todd.
