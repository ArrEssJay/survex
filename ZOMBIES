Bugs which are unrepeatable, or believed fixed but never confirmed by
the person who reported the bug, or which are simply not relevant any
longer:

Another remark: Did you know that you can crash CAVEROT by setting the
scale factor to very large or very small values (probably larger/smaller
than MIN/MAXFLOAT)?! This would be worth an error catch....
[Seems to be fixed by newer allegro version - fix not confirmed by immoh]

I still get that random memory error [from cavern.exe, 0.90 alpha5, win95]
(Wookey is unable to reproduce this - Peter thinks it might be dodgy
hardware).

[Running caverot] my screen "freezes" with no image, and I'm forced to
restart the computer to get the screen back. [win95, 0.90 alpha (5 or
earlier)]

[Maybe an allegro problem - I've upgraded to allegro 3.1 to see if that
cures the problem.  PWJ suggests the graphics card might be the problem.
No confirmation of fix from Bill]

directx caverot: redraw after switching away and back code seems to kill
program; resolutions (use desktop res?); windowed mode doesn't work;
command line switches don't seem to work...
[directx caverot is now eclipsed by aven]
