Another remark: Did you know that you can crash CAVEROT by setting the
scale factor to very large or very small values (probably larger/smaller
than MIN/MAXFLOAT)?! This would be worth an error catch....
[Seems to be fixed by newer allegro version, let me know if you still get
problems - Olly]

[On an Aleph1 PC Card in an Acorn RISC OS machine, in DJGPP+Allegro caverot]
the help screen flashes up and then disappears - this is probably our problem,
not yours (the VESA 2 support being relatively new) :-)

DJGPP+Allegro caverot doesn't run well under NT.  The best resolution is
320x200 and there are other niggles (e.g. on an NT 4 server, the mouse works
in the mode-picker, but not in caverot itself).  In this situation, use the
directx version of caverot instead.

I still get that random memory error [from cavern.exe, 0.90 alpha5, win95]
(Wookey is unable to reproduce this - Peter thinks it might be dodgy
hardware).

[Running caverot] my screen "freezes" with no image, and I'm forced to
restart the computer to get the screen back. [win95, 0.90 alpha (5 or
earlier)]

(Maybe an allegro problem - I've upgraded to allegro 3.1 to see if that
cures the problem).  PWJ suggests the graphics card might be the problem.

[in 0.92pre6, allegro version] CAVEROT Keys :- Delete, U & D and the
cursor keys do not work.

svx092pre5 [...] did produce an error file much longer than whatever
version I ran before.  [Previous version deleted so unable to discover
what it was.]

[directx caverot is now eclipsed by winaven]
directx caverot: redraw after switching away and back code seems to kill
program; resolutions (use desktop res?); windowed mode doesn't work;
command line switches don't seem to work...
