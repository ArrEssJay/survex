Changes in 0.81:

* survex: Network reduction bug fixed (fix carried back from 0.90 development)

Changes in 0.80:

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has debugging information stripped
  from .exe files once more, so they are rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work

* Unix versions now build use GNU autoconf - to build just unpack, run
  "./configure" then "make"

* Messages file now represents accents like in HTML (e.g. &eacute;
  for é)

* caverot: fixed up standard DOS (allegro) version to work much
  better.  In particular, it will now try to choose a video mode for
  itself (use --mode-picker at the end of the command line to get the
  mode picker), and keyboard and mouse initialisation problems are
  cured

* survex: You can now use DOS or UNIX style filenames (/ or \ for
  directory separator) on any platform and they will be translated to
  the native format for your OS.  This makes datasets much more
  portable.

* survex: "Unique" option changed to "Truncate" and now truncates
  names if set

* Removed artificial limit on survey station name length (was 12
  characters per prefix component)

* Many other minor changes

Changes in 0.72:

* Expiry timeout removed from all programs

Changes in 0.71:

* printdm: Native Printer support for Cannon BJ printers.

* caverot: DJGPP version for use of more than 640K

* xcaverot: Updated to have most of the features of Caverot (non-overlapping
  lables, scale bar & tilt/direction indicators)

Changes in 0.70:

* Language support for Catalan, Spanish, and Italian added

* caverot: tilt indicator added

* caverot: constant speed rotation (e.g. for small caves on fast computers)

* caverot: Smooth plan <-> elevation transitions on faster machines

* caverot: Two files can be read in and displayed in different colour
  (eg cave and surface data)

* caverot: Extended memory version so big datasets can be displayed on
  DOS version

* Printer Drivers: INI file used instead of multiple configuration files.

* Printer Drivers: Defaults set-able for all print settings

* Printer Drivers: Option to print tilted plots

* printhpgl: now has origin in centre of page option (and is default)

* printdm/printpcl: Printer font made ISO-8859-1 compatible

* Printer Drivers: Dotted borders to facilitate cutting to size with scissors

* Printer Drivers: Scale bar length limited to save time on large plots

* survex: If adjusted tape is negative then warning generated

* survex: User-definable characters for input (e.g. for odd characters
  in imported station names)

Changes in 0.62:

* printdm: bug-fix: a graphics postfix setting had been added to
  dm.cfg, but if this was not used then printing would go wrong

* printpcl: added an option for printers that do not understand the
  PCL Vertical Tab command - see PCL.cfg

Changes in 0.61:

* Includes a new version of caverot that arranges the labels so that
  they don't overlap.

Changes in 0.60:

* French and German translations greatly improved

* survex: Survey grades now supported

* survex: *calibrate, *data, and *units enhanced in a backwards
  compatible way

* survex: survey network is now split at articulation points
  (faster/less memory)

* survex: Omitted clino readings give a vertical sd of tape/sqrt(10)

* survex: filenames with spaces are now supported - just put them in
  quotes ("")

* diffpos/3dtodxf: improved and made more robust

* caverot: "sliding point" code improved to work even in really
  extreme cases

* caverot: added a "compass"

* caverot: memory usage improved, so it now copes with larger files

* And a host of more minor improvements and bug-fixes
