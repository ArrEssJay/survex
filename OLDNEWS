Changes in 0.90:

* caverot: MSDOS Allegro mode-picker now reappears if an invalid mode
  is chosen (caverot used to unhelpfully exit in this case).

  contents

Changes in 0.90 beta3:

  same directory where the first .svx file is found.  You can set a
  different directory using the "--output" command line option, which
  can point to a directory or a file.

* cavern: "*truncate off" rather than "*truncate 0"

* survex: added wrapper to convert survex invocation into cavern invocation

* hto filters moved into separate subdirectory of source distribution

* cavern: fixed bug which included stations with 4 or more connections
  in the .3d file several times

* added "miniam.pl" which generates makefiles for BorlandC and RISC OS

* printdm/printpcl: weren't showing text - problem with new format
  font file

* check for old SURVEXLANG codes (engi, fren, germ, ...) now case
  insensitive

Changes in 0.90 beta2:

* new messages extracted for translation

* printps: much smaller postscript output

* printps: real circles in postscript output

* nicer infobox on printouts

* caverot: help page improved

* now use GNU getopt to parse command line options

* cavern: -f and @ removed

* cavern: -n, -t and -u replaced by *-commands

* source code tidied up considerably

  should be faster and smaller

* new format font file for printdm/printpcl (faster and smaller)

* cavern: GCC format error/warning messages to allow clicking on
  messages to jump to the problem line in editors which support it
  (e.g. GNU emacs and jed)

* Now uses GNU automake under Unix which makes my life a lot easier and also
  provides "make install"

Changes in 0.81:

Changes in 0.80:

* Added ChangeLog

* DOS binary distribution now includes files: BUGS NEWS TODO ChangeLog

* Cross-compiler build for DOS now has debugging information stripped
  from .exe files once more, so they are rather smaller

* Sources now include configure.in for those wanting to do major development
  work

* Unix versions now build use GNU autoconf - to build just unpack, run
  "./configure" then "make"

* Messages file now represents accents like in HTML (e.g. &eacute;
  for é)

* caverot: fixed up standard DOS (allegro) version to work much
  better.  In particular, it will now try to choose a video mode for
  itself (use --mode-picker at the end of the command line to get the
  mode picker), and keyboard and mouse initialisation problems are
  cured

* survex: You can now use DOS or UNIX style filenames (/ or \ for
  directory separator) on any platform and they will be translated to
  the native format for your OS.  This makes datasets much more
  portable.

  names if set

* Removed artificial limit on survey station name length (was 12
  characters per prefix component)

* Many other minor changes

  lables, scale bar & tilt/direction indicators)

* caverot: tilt indicator added

* caverot: constant speed rotation (e.g. for small caves on fast computers)

* caverot: Smooth plan <-> elevation transitions on faster machines

* caverot: Two files can be read in and displayed in different colour
  (eg cave and surface data)

* caverot: Extended memory version so big datasets can be displayed on
  DOS version

* Printer Drivers: INI file used instead of multiple configuration files.

* Printer Drivers: Defaults set-able for all print settings

* Printer Drivers: Option to print tilted plots

* printhpgl: now has origin in centre of page option (and is default)

* printdm/printpcl: Printer font made ISO-8859-1 compatible

* Printer Drivers: Dotted borders to facilitate cutting to size with scissors

* Printer Drivers: Scale bar length limited to save time on large plots

* survex: If adjusted tape is negative then warning generated

* survex: User-definable characters for input (e.g. for odd characters
  in imported station names)

Changes in 0.62:

* printdm: bug-fix: a graphics postfix setting had been added to
  dm.cfg, but if this was not used then printing would go wrong

* printpcl: added an option for printers that do not understand the
  PCL Vertical Tab command - see PCL.cfg
