Still to do to aven 1.1.*:

Make crosses work again!

Blobs are a bit inefficient - want BlobsBegin() and ...End() and a
SetBlobColour() call; also pass all blobs of the same colour together.

Draw the measuring line directly onto the front buffer, so we can remove it
with a copy from the back buffer and redraw it in the new position without a
re-render.

Sort out odd textured font spacing niggles...

Process all pending input before rerendering to improve responsiveness.

Check timing code - we need to glFinish to ensure it's all drawn, and that
may be needed to get meaningful timing info.

---

TODO entries which aren't likely to be done for 1.0.x:

Warn bearings not 3 digits, gradient not <sign><digit><digit>

Allow angles as deg/min/sec (for theodolite data) (060°10'15" as 060 10 15,
or 060.1005 (crap notation))

Add support for bearings of form N20E (ie [NS][0-9]+[EW])?

should % after a clino reading work?

cavern: auto declination?

Sort out gross error detection code

add to UNITS: percentage

Fixing a point by triangulation?

Theodolite + level:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  delta(vertical) / maybe "clino" instead

Theodolite only:
  delta(bearing (relative to 0 at start)
  delta(horizontal)
  infinite sd for z

Infinite sds so we can fix in x and y only (or z only)?

use more accuracy than nearest point (1/72") in printps?

funcs to spot differences between caves:
  display two plots at once, maybe flash in ram banks?
  compare nets

? make printps & printhpgl one program; make printdm and printpcl one
program - autosense (by looking at argv[0]) which we're being run as
(and use symbolic link in Unix). Provide command line option as
override (so we can use alias/batchfile for DOS)?

Label lengths aren't considered when working out image size in prcore.c,
so a long label can spill off the edge of the printout

"message.c" add option to read errors from disc only when needed, to help
when memory is tight

printer driver name spills over one page on Wookey's printer (printdm)

For warnings such as "Suspicious compass reading", report the reading
in question in the error message (in the text form given in the file).
Also report values when warning about problems with processed readings.

legs: implied: inloop/plumb/nosurvey, diving, other styles

legs: "dubious" for "tapeless" legs - bearing along continuation...

legs: hydrology - fossil/active/not recorded/static water/underwater
(sump) [diving underwater by default? except style can mean altimeter
too...]

legs: floor type - mud/sand/breakdown/flowstone/etc and can then used
LRUD to draw crude survey...

legs: "commented out" flag?  syntax check data but otherwise ignore

station flags: "important" - e.g. top camp "fixed" point /
junction,deadend (implied by order) /
articulation pt (know for nodes I think a station is if at least one
of its nodes is)

Allow valid range for an instrument to be specified.  Tie in with
*instrument.  *units date - ranges for dates - e.g. "1990-" or
"jun-aug"...

Subject: xcaverot
From: Olly

xcaverot missing:, ^A (lazy redraw during drags), ^R (reverse sense of
controls), escape vs q(?)

switch_to_(plan|elevation) in xcaverot should animate but code is just
broken.

Shift-ed keys should move faster as they do in aven and caverot

?try using labels.c in xcaverot to see if XRegions are better or not?

Maybe station lists should know how long they are?

caverot help page needs fettling so that it appears centrally (and indeed
so that it all fits on the screen in chunky CGA modes) [BC fns to look at:
textheight("W"), textwidth(), settextstyle()]

cope with any combination of readings which gives enough info ???

Articulation point code: ideally the articulation point code should allow
further network reductions to happen after splitting at articulation
points?

leg and station "comments":

*data stationdata station left right up down comment

1 1.0 - 50+ 0.5 "large cairn"

2 ...

*data normal station l r u d comment newline tape compass clino

1 1.0 - 50+ 0.5 "large cairn"

  10.78 123 -03

2 ...

comment can be omitted "-" or not present if at end of line...?
commentall?

GPS support (e.g. export survey as GPS coords)

print to an image file (use gd?)

Allow covariances to be specified in cartesian style?

back bearings?

aven grid code -> printer drivers, caverot, and xcaverot too.
grid crosses option (only draw cross at intersections, not a full grid).
[(x,y) of a point to go through (easting, northing)
x spacing, y spacing (default to x spacing)
orientation (bearing of y-axis?) (defaults to 0)]

printout of current view from aven...

*fix with datums etc

Profile aven (for speed and memory usage)

glcaverot features - depth fogging...

Mark: "surface.png is for a textured landscape -- there needs to be a
menu option to select the texturing on/off, and this should be the
texture used. map.png is just a different surface overlay for Loser."

Rework presentation recording into the more usual "New"/"Save
As"/"Load"/"Save" mould

Aven presentation recording crashes if you select the "Finish and
Save" menu item twice.

Aven:

<li>by default put crosses on those points with no legs attached (unused
fixed points)?

<li>label junctions/dead ends?

<li>colour by traverse

<li>section colouring/selective labelling

<li>clipping - want to select a clip sphere (or maybe cube) centred on
centre on rotation I think.

<li>colour by cave (and more generally by sub-prefix):
"aven --survey 161 --colour-by-sub-prefix all.3d" would result in
lhroute, rhroute, adrian, etc all getting different colours...

<li>Some way to display all the names of an equated station (e.g. in pop-up
window or the info panel).

<li>Highlight a whole survey by clicking on it in the tree...
